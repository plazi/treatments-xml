<subSubSection type="biology_ecology">
<paragraph pageNumber="354">(4). Very common, especially in the forest, but also in open land; 2500 ft. to sea-level. Formicarium generally under a log; sometimes in rotten wood, or under stones. It may consist of many, hundred individuals, but is oftener small. Winged males are rarely found in the colonies, but the winged females may escape observation from their ' close resemblance to the workers. When disturbed the ants move above lazily, and are not very pugnacious; a large nest, however, is not to be examined with impunity, as the ants sting rather severely if they get on the skin. In the daytime the ants keep to shady places, and are nearly always found on the ground or on logs. I do not know if they also forage at night. These ants accumulate the mounds of earth and dead flowers sometimes found in the forest, but I have never seen them cutting leaves or flowers; they may do so at night. The females fly at night. The workers walk about with. the jaws wide open, at right angles to the head, but close them quickly when disturbed.</paragraph>

<paragraph lastPageNumber="355" pageNumber="354">This species, so far as I can judge, makes extensive underground works; probably those found under stones, logs, &amp; c., are merely at the surface ends of tunnels leading to the deeper and perhaps large formicarium. In the woods are often seen mounds of sand and bits of earth, from which tunnels lead downward; and these ants are always found in the tunnels. The mounds may be two feet in diameter, and a foot high, indicating extensive works, from which the earth ia taken. Mingled with the earth there are nearly always quantities of small flowers, probably picked up on the ground when they fell from trees; great quantities of the flowers are also frequently seen under the stones and logs, where the ants are found with their pupae. I have not seen the ants gathering these flowers, and judge that they collect them at night.</paragraph>

<subSubSection type="materials_examined">
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(5). Rather rare; distinct from No 4. All seem more like the specimens sent.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(5 a). Thickets by sea-shore at the &quot; Villa &quot; Estate; southern end of the island. Oct. 14 th. Under a stone in loamy sand at the root of a tree. About forty individuals in the nest, apparently all workers; they had many larvae, which, when disturbed, were carried to deep passages under the stone.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(5 b). Richmond Estate (leeward); open valley near sea-level. Oct. 31 st. Under a. log. Apparently a formicarium, but I could find no winged ones.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(5 c). Fitz-Hugh Estate (leeward), Nov. 13 th. Open place near sea-level; under a stone. Only a few ants seen.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(5 d). Windward side; shady bed of Dry River; near the sea. Jan. 2 nd. Under a stone. The species is common along the windward coast, under stones and logs. The communities apparently are not large; but, like No. 4, this species seems to make extensive underground works, with outlets under stones and logs.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(6 a). These males, as I suppose, belong to No. 4 or 5; they came to light at night. Golden Grove Estate (leeward), 500 ft. The date was lost, but if my memory serves, they were taken in July or August.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(6 b). Forest, Morne a Garou, 2000 ft. Nov. 1 st. Beaten from foliage. No 4 is common in this forest.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(15 a). Richmond Estate; open valley near sea-level. Oct. 31 st. A single specimen found under a log. Many workers of No. 4 were under the same log.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageNumber="355">(15 b). Near the Wallibou River (leeward), 500 ft. Jan. 10 th. Open damp hill-side. Found alone under a stone.</paragraph>
