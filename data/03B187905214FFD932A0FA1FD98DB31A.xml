also show some similarities with the preceding species: they have a short common end piece, and the ventral wall of the lobes is densely covered with long bristles; but in most other structures there are great differences: the lobes are considerably longer than the respective tergite, they are narrowly lappet-shaped, only weakly sclerotized and throughout dorso-ventrally flattened, leaving only little space between the two layers consisting of the dorsal and ventral wall of the pouch. Accordingly the opening of the pouch is also narrow, slit-like—between the edge of the opening (

The structure of the pouch and its lobes in this species is—as compared to the other species of this subgenus—unexpectedly complex. It is not completely clear how the very narrow cavities of the pouch are connected and on which ways the secretions produced in the lobes can pass into the pit. Histological sectioning or microtomography studies will be necessary to clarify these questions. The system can be seen as a preadaptation for the development of the pouch structure present in the
