a wide range of MB morphologies in extant taxa (20), varying with both reproductive phase and the position of the egg within the reproductive tract (6).

<emphasis box="[468,494,1838,1870]" italics="true" pageId="4" pageNumber="1459">is</emphasis>
hypothesized to provide a buffer against excessive and debilitating bone resorption during shelling (4, 28). It 
<emphasis box="[150,175,1968,2000]" italics="true" pageId="4" pageNumber="1459">is</emphasis>
most extensive in smaller taxa with high reproductive rates, because of the demand for rapid mobilization of skeletal calcium for shelling. Extinct theropods produced hardshelled eggs, as did other dinosaurs and all extant birds (29, 30). Although egg size is not known, eggs were most likely smaller relative to overall body size than in extant birds, resulting in less demand for bone calcium reserves and reducing the need to offset resorption. These factors may also contribute to the smaller ratio of medullary to cortical thickness in theropods than in extant birds. Finally, T.
