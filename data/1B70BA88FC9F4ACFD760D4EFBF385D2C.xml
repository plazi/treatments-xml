As a consequence of this enigmatic occurrence, funding was sought from Environment Australia to establish whether this endangered (as listed in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999), or critically endangered (as listed in Pogonoski &amp; Pollard 2003) species, is well represented in the area.

None was captured in the Fitzroy River. The original specimen, a semi-mature male measuring 994 mm TL (Table 1, Fig. 3), was captured at the entrance of a small tributary in the northern branch of Doctors Creek. A further two specimens (WAM P.32598.001, WAM P.32599.001) were captured at this site during this study, with the remaining four being captured at the mouth of another small tributary approximately 20 km south of the mouth of Doctors Creek (Fig. 1). Both sites were macrotidal (with tidal movements of up to 10 m twice daily), dominated by mangroves and had salinities between 32.0 and 36.6 parts per thousand (ppt). Water temperatures at the collection sites were between 22 and 23°C. Sites were typified by low water clarity with secchi depths of only 3 to 4 cm. All specimens were captured during the outgoing tide.

Only the largest male (1418 mm TL) was mature (claspers fully calcified), while the largest females were immature. The 994 mm TL specimen collected in 2002 had semicalcified claspers, indicating that maturation had not yet been obtained.

, with these specimens representing almost half of all those known. Although this rarity may reflect a paucity of ichthyological exploration of the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia, it should be noted that the species was not encountered during an elasmobranch survey of 160 sites throughout 39 river/creek systems of northern Australia, including 12 river/creek systems in the Kimberley (Thorburn et al. 2003). This species, as its common name implies, was previously only known from riverine habitats with salinities ranging from 2 to 26 ppt (Larson 2000). During this study, however, it was only encountered in macrotidal marine conditions (32 to 36.6 ppt). Additionally, this species was not captured during an extensive study of the fish fauna at 70 sites in the freshwaters of the Fitzroy River (Morgan et al. 2002, 2004), which drains into King Sound, has a catchment of almost 90 000 km2 and has the highest recorded runoff of any river in Western Australia (Anon. 1993, Storey 1998). Furthermore, studies of Kimberley rivers by Allen (1975), Hutchins (1977, 1981) and Allen and Leggett (1990) did not record

collected in Western Australia have both a wider range in total vertebral count (i.e. 140-151 cf 147-148) and number of diplospondylous caudal centra (i.e. 64-70 cf 65-68) than that previously reported by Compagno &amp; Niem (1998). The extension in range of total vertebrae and diplospondylous caudal centra can most likely be attributed to the few specimens upon which previous counts were made. The length range of the animals captured, combined with maturity data suggest that they attain sexual maturity when&gt;1350 mm TL, at least, for females, and between 1191 and 1418 mm TL for males (Table 1). The original specimen collected in 2002 (994 mm TL), although shorter than the second largest male collected in June 2003, was found to be semi-mature. This maturity at a shorter length is likely to be attributed to its severe deformity, and the length may not be representative for an animal of similar age.

population in King Sound. Heupal et al. (1999) reports that spinal deformities in elasmobranchs are rare, with only a few cases of individuals of several species noted. The cause of the deformities is often unknown, but Heupal et al. (1999) attributes them to parasitic infection, arthritis, injury, disease, tumours, malnutrition or genetic abnormality. Considering the high occurrence of this deformity, with almost half of those collected from King Sound possessing some degree of vertebral fusing, it is possible that the malformations are caused by a genetic abnormality, indicative of inbreeding within a small gene pool. Skeletal deformities as a result of inbreeding have been observed in hatchery reared fishes (Tave 1986), and other vertebrates, including humans (Jones 1996).

possesses at least several morphological characters that may be reflective of this species persistence in the highly turbid macrotidal environment of King Sound, and indeed the rivers of the Northern Territory and Papua New Guinea. These include: a reduced eye (an average of 0.87 % of the total length) which is approximately half the eye diameter of the bull shark

(Carcharhinidae) (Taniuchi et al. 1991), a species known to enter freshwater rivers including the Fitzroy River (Thorburn et al. 2003); the occurrence of a large number of sensory ampullae covering the head (Fig. 4), which would compensate for any lack in visual capacity that this species may encounter while foraging in turbid waters; and the possession of large pectoral fins (and second dorsal fin) would assist in the motility and stability of this species in the shallow rapid flowing waters of King Sound (and rivers).

The feeder creeks of King Sound, and in particular those of the macrotidal Doctors Creek and Fitzroy River mouth, may be an important refuge for
