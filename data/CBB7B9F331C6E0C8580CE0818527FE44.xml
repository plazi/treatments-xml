The head is prolonged into a beak (the mandibles, etc.); the whole body clothed with short outstanding hairs of different lengths and structure. (N. B. â€” The dark spot in the figure where the eye might be supposed to be is, of course, not an eye at all, as ant larvae never possess eyes.)</paragraph>
