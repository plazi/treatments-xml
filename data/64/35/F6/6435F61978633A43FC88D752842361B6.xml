The perianth has about 50 tepals in several series. The tepals are broad with correspondingly broad, transversely elongate and narrowly rhomboidal bases. The tepals are composed of thin-walled, equiaxial cells. The tepals of the outer one or two series are covered by a thin cuticle (Textfig. 2c, d) while those of the inner three or four series have a thick cuticle on their outer surface over a layer of epidermal cells that also appear to be thick-walled (
