<paragraph pageId="15" pageNumber="114">Notes on Type Locality. The type locality, herein established at the above coordinates, was implied from the type labels because the actual location where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain; his label data only generalized his collecting along the route he took during his expedition to Haiti. La Visite is a National Park, Parc de La Visite, located along Highway 101 in a relatively flat, high elevation area along this highway at 6000 feet in the Massif de la Selle south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, Darlington almost certainly did not collect this new species within La Visite National Park based on the discussion presented below under Ecology. In consideration of that information, the type locality for this species is more precisely established above using Google Earth©. The type locality was chosen to be a site adjoining La Visite slightly to the north (Fig. 18F) with the coordinates shown above.</paragraph>

The exact locality, and hence the habitat, where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain. Darlington's labels on his 1934-collecting trip to the Massif de la Selle indicate that he first collected south of Port-au-Prince from &quot;Kenskoff [Kenscoff] to La Visite and vicinity&quot; and then later on his return trip along an &quot;auto road&quot; from Furcy to Kenskoff [Kenscoff]. The auto road he took is most likely the same as current Highway 101 that traverses the Massif de la Selle from Port-au-Prince to near the southern coast of Haiti. Suitable habitats where Darlington collected likely occurred along this road at elevations of roughly 5000 feet. An image from Google Earth© (Fig. 18E), and a geotagged image from http://flickr.com taken in early 2010 along Highway 101 below its summit in the vicinity of Parc de La Visite (Fig. 18F), both show an unimproved rocky road cut into a steep slope with sparse vegetation. The road banks and roadway appear eroded and traversed mostly on foot by local inhabitants. In Parc de La Visite itself, this highway reaches 6000 feet elevations, becomes much more level, and runs through stands of

notes that his base camp for collecting at La Visite was in &quot;tall pine forest at 6,000 feet beside the 
<normalizedToken originalValue="Rivière">Riviere</normalizedToken>
Chotard&quot; [currently known as Cascade de Seguin]. However, he states that his collecting within the pine stands produced no carabids. Thus, the habitat where Darlington collected this new species is likely situated along the road he took to reach Parc de La Visite, but at a lower elevation than where he camped. The site in Fig. 18F with eroded clay banks along Highway 101 at about 1755 m (5760 ft) has been selected as the type locality for this new species. The only known specimens of this new species were collected during September.

du l'Ouest, Massif de la Selle. Kenskoff [Kenscoff], Furcy, and La Visite are localities on the labels of the type specimens collected by P.J. Darlington in 1934. This species likely occurs in suitable habitats from Kenscoff to the northwestern boundary of Parc de La Visite along Highway 101. This highway from Furcy southward to La Visite traverses a series of long ridges at about 5000 feet elevation before rising abruptly to 6000 feet where it crosses over to the southern slopes of the Massif de la Selle.

<paragraph pageId="18" pageNumber="117">This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of the late Philip J. Darlington, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The species name acknowledges his contributions as the preeminent American carabidologist during the Mid-20th Century. During his 1934 expedition to Haiti, Darlington was the first coleopterist to collect in the Massif de la Selle, the highest mountains in Haiti. Darlington collected the types of this new species along the autoroute taken by his expedition across the Massif de la Selle in the vicinity of La Visite, now designated as Parc de La Visite, a National Park in this southeastern Haitian mountain range.</paragraph>

are very similar for both species especially the unusual form of the recurved terminal tip of the stylet, although this differs in the degree of its curvature for each species. Females of both species possess similar small, paired mediolateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum. Moreover, the elytral markings of both species are quite similar in pattern with only the extremities of the humeral lunule evident; this marking on all specimens examined consistently was divided into a humeral mark and a discal spot variously reduced or enlarged depending on the specimen. Additionally, the middle lunule always terminates near the suture in a broad hook never anteriorly recurved. However, the distinctiveness of these two species is confirmed by differences between the two in the size of the recurved aedeagus apex of males, as well as, differences in the extent of development of the membranous longitudinal median band and membranous wedge on the 5th abdominal sternum of females.
