Back in Washington, Coquillett’s supervisor C.V. Riley was constantly “putting out fires” of complaints of farmers, vintners, dairymen, etc. nationwide with regard to injurious insects causing damage to crops, trees, vines, and domestic animals. One particular set of complaints was coming from [no surprise] California (and had been for a few years). Riley was obviously impressed (or at least satisfied) enough with Coquillett’s locust report to send him on a new mission. Orange groves were being subjected to damage by the introduced cottony-cushion scale. Coquillett was to join forces with exploratory entomologist Albert Koebele and find a solution to the problem. Riley had theorized that going to the home of the scale (
<collectingCountry box="[779,886,1553,1578]" name="Australia" pageId="8" pageNumber="9">Australia</collectingCountry>
, where it was not causing the unchecked damage that it was in 
<collectingRegion box="[303,418,1589,1614]" country="United States of America" name="California" pageId="8" pageNumber="9">California</collectingRegion>
) might prove successful in finding what insect or other organism was keeping populations of the scale in check or possibly could help eradicate it. In late 1885, the two began work. But, due to the diametrically opposed personalities of the two men, trouble soon ensued. Koebele discredited Coquillett’s work and the two feuded over who was in charge. Coincidentally or not, funds for Coquillett’s position ran out in the summer of 1886 and his employment with the

Department of Agriculture was terminated. He was reemployed the next year, but the short time in between federal paychecks proved a useful period for Coquillett.

Loss of employment with the federal government seemed not to deter the fervor Coquillett had for his work and, after meeting with two

3. This of course is the same concoction of chemicals prisons use for executing prisoners by lethal gas. for each tree and the method of mixing the two chemicals caused the gas to kill parts of the trees. By conducting trials with different dosages and tent designs, Coquillett was able to reduce the treatment to 15 minutes per tree. However, one day while experimenting with this gas treatment, Coquillett almost met an unfortunate fate.

) going out into the groves to see how Coquillett was doing and saw evidence that he had left in a hurry. They finally tracked him down in his apartment (only a block away from the orchard—see below) and found out he had come into contact with the gas and feared for his life. He vowed never to work with the gas again. They finally convinced him to wear a suit for safety while using the gas and he reluctantly went back to work. Coquillett’s work on the gas treatment was a tremendous success and was publicized throughout the world as the method for getting rid of pestiferous insects, especially scales, in orchards. Riley was disappointed that the

Back in the employ of Riley a few months later, Coquillett returned to work with Koebele to solve the scale problem. Koebele went to 
<collectingCountry box="[468,571,1485,1510]" name="Australia" pageId="9" pageNumber="10">Australia</collectingCountry>
to find insects that might control the scale, and Coquillett would be the experimenter who received the shipments, maintained the colonies, and reared them in cages to see which worked best. Various parasites and predators were shipped and tested in cages and in the field, but one in particular became world famous: the

, a ladybird beetle as conspicuous as the cottonycushion scale on which it readily fed. The beetles multiplied rapidly, were easily transferred from grove to grove, and were voracious feeders. Within a year, the scale was virtually eliminated from the region and California’s citrus industry was saved.

And, thus, more trouble ensued for Coquillett. Friction between state and federal officials over credit for the success resulted in a number of attacks on Coquillett and the federal government that were printed in the local papers. Coquillett remained quiet and did not respond to most of the disparaging remarks and personal attacks. In 1893, Riley had endured enough of the bad press the

“I regret very much the necessity that bids me leave this interesting field of labor where the principal work of my life thus far has been wrought, and where many pleasant friendships have been formed.
