<paragraph pageId="12" pageNumber="57">To check the morphological variation with size, ten specimens (1.64-2.73 mm) were partly dissected and the cheliped, the pereopod 1 and a ventral hyposphenium of pleonite were examined for different sizes and some variations were found: 1) in the cheliped, the dactylus and fixed finger of the males were modified in size: in the cheliped of the large sized males (over 2 mm), the cutting edge of the dactylus is extended and strongly curved and the processes on the proximal margin are prominently developed; 2) the number and size of setae on the pereopod 1 propodus increased with size; 3) a ventral hyposphenium of the male pleonite is modified from a rounded shape to a subrectangular shape, with body length reaching over 2 mm.</paragraph>
