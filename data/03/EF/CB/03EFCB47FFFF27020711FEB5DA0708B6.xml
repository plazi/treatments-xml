The astragalus with its ascending process, and the distinct calcaneum, are also shown in position. The almost exact correspondence of these different parts in the bird and reptile will be manifest to every anatomist.

and of Birds. The distal ends of these bones correspond in size and relative position in the two groups, but here, in the present specimen, the reptilian features cease, and those of typical Birds replace them. In all the reptiles known hitherto, and especially in Dinosaurs, the second, third, and fourth metatarsals are prominent in front, at their proximal ends, and the third is usually the largest and strongest. In birds, the place of the third is taken above by the second and fourth, the third being crowded backward, and very much diminished in size.
