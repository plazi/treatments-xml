These bite-force estimates make it possible to evaluate speculations on tyrannosaur tooth strength and potential behaviours using comparisons with extant taxa. The largest m aximum bite force measureme nts or estimates for extant vertebrates at posterior tooth positions are: 550 N for labrador dogs9, 749 N for humans10, 1,412 N for wolves11, 1,446 N for dusky sharks (location of force measurement within jaw not given)n, 1,712 N for orangutans1.1, 4,168 for lions11, and 13,300 N for American alligators14 (K. A Vliet, personal communication). Using bite force as a relative indicator of dental strength, the results suggest that

teeth were as strong as, or in most cases substantially stronger than, those of any extant taxa tested to date. Consequently speculations that their dentition was mechanically weak were not supported.

rex maxillary tooth, after casts made from some ofthe deeper bite marks revealed the size and shape of the teeth that had impacted the pelvis8 • The replica was penetrated into the ilia sections at 1 mm s-1 to a depth of 11.5 mm, equivalent to the maximum depth of the deepest ilium bite mark8 • Forces were measured with an MTS 25 N strain-gauge-based axial load cell accurate to 0.2%. The forces increased with increasing penetration depth even after the cortical layer had been perforated and the underlying cancellous bone was being crushed. The increase in force with penetration depth is attributed to a greater cortical surface area coming into contact with the semi-conical penetrator tooth as it descended through the ilia.

These morphological similarities imply similarity in function19 Alligators use their teeth to procure large prey and to engage conspecifics during confrontations20 Both activities demand teeth that can sustain large compression and bending forces, particularly because impacts with bones are frequent20 The bite-force estimates and tooth mark evidence show that
