Bush dogs are diurnal. They hunt as a group searching for the spoor of their prey. They search for pacas, sniffing for their scent along large or small streams. When they find paca spoor, all the members of the pack begin to follow it. When one dog finds the paca’s burrow, it calls the other dogs. A large male dog enters the burrow.

then dashes out of one of the other exits of its burrow, and all the dogs chase it down, barking.

typically goes to a stream, follows it to a deep bend, plunges in, and holds its breath underwater. The bush dogs arrive and the leader barks out orders for the others in the pack to surround the deep stream bend ready to pounce on

When they find a nine-banded long-nosed armadillo in a leaf nest on the ground, they surround the nest, and one of the bush dogs jumps on it (to make the armadillo come out).

Then they kill the agouti in the log or hole, or they kill it as it exits. Bush dogs rest after eating, lying in a dry spot for a while, before hunting again.

REMARKS: Bush dogs have long been something of a zoological enigma, with their small size, highly developed social behavior, hypercarnivorous dentition, absurdly short legs, partially webbed feet, diurnal activity, and a remarkable ability to swim underwater (Sheldon, 1992; 
<bibRefCitation author="Beisiegel, B. M. &amp; G. L. Zuercher" pageId="44" pagination="1 - 6" refId="ref60820" refString="Beisiegel, B. M., and G. L. Zuercher. 2005. Speothos venaticus. Mammalian Species 783: 1 - 6." type="journal article" year="2005">Beisiegel and Zuercher, 2005</bibRefCitation>
). This odd combination of traits seems all the more extraordinary by comparison with those of closely related

(the maned wolf; Perini et al., 2010), a much larger, solitary, omnivorous, long-legged, crepuscular/nocturnal, and strictly nonaquatic species. Attempts to explain bush dog morphobehavioral traits have included seemingly implausible suggestions that packs of these diminutive, dachshundlike animals can run down and kill much larger prey (e.g., peccaries, deer, and even tapirs; Zuercher et al., 2004); that their short legs and hypercarnivorous dentition are the nonadaptive consequence of phyletic dwarfing (Wayne and O’Brien, 1987); that their partially webbed feet are somehow useful for walking on soft soil near streams (

); and that they might cache their food underwater (Kleiman, 1972). A defining aspect of the literature on this species is that most information about diet and behavior is derived from captive studies; few biologists have seen bush dogs alive in the wild for more than a few minutes at a time (e.g.,

<superScript attach="left" box="[197,206,620,637]" fontSize="7" pageId="45">6</superScript>
is clearly adaptive for entering burrows or hollow logs to drag or flush their inhabitants (armadillos, pacas, agoutis) to the surface. Their cooperative social behavior and swimming abilities may be especially important for hunting pacas, whose streamside burrows have multiple exits, and whose evasive behavior often includes hiding underwater (Tate, 1931; 
<bibRefCitation author="Cabrera, A. &amp; J. Yepes" pageId="45" refId="ref61468" refString="Cabrera, A., and J. Yepes. 1940. Mamiferos sud-americanos (vida, costumbres, y descripcion).

; personal obs.). Although Matses accounts of bush dog hunting behavior include obvious anthropomorphisms, the ambush tactics they describe are plausible in the context of hunting behavior previously reported for other social canids (e.g., wolves and African hunting dogs). From these accounts, and from previously published anecdotes and captive observations,
