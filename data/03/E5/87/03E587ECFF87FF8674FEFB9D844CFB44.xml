Numerous subspecies of the jaguar have long been recognized (e.g., by Wozencraft, 2005). The western Amazonian population was referred to the nominotypical form in the last specimenbased revision (Pocock, 1939), but jaguar “subspecies” seem not to correspond either to mtDNA phylogeographic units (

The first, kamun (an unanalyzable term commonly encountered among other Panoan languages), like bëdi, can also refer collectively to members of the category that includes all felids, wild canids, and the tayra. A second archaic synonym, winsad, specific to the jaguar, also means “frightening.” The third archaic synonym, chuisad, also specific to the jaguar, is not analyzable and has no other current meaning. In the language used in the Matses’ komok ceremony, the jaguar is called mëndu, a monomorphemic terms that also designates the domestic dog.</paragraph>

Because bëdi can refer to any felid, or can be used generically, the term bëdidapa (literally “large jaguar/felid”) is used to specify the jaguar, although it can also refer to a Matses-recognized variety of the jaguar. In fact, there are two over- differentiated varieties: bëdidapa and wispan kamun (“jaguar of the stars,” in reference to its particular spotted pattern). The wispan kamun variety is said to be fiercer and to have a larger head and a smaller body than the typical variety. Interestingly, melanistic jaguars seem to be absent in Matses territory.

<paragraph blockId="52.[108,638,226,1738]" pageId="52">Jaguars are not currently of any economic importance to the Matses. They are not eaten, nor are they kept as pets. Several decades ago some Matses hunters participated in the illegal fur trade, trapping jaguars and other cats in box traps made from split palm logs and baited with capuchin monkey meat.</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="52.[108,638,226,1738]" pageId="52">All Matses (especially women and children) fear jaguars, which often stalk people without attacking them. Although jaguars usually run away when they are encountered, occasionally a jaguar will bound toward a person. When they do so, the animal can sometimes be scared off by yelling loudly or by pounding on a buttress root. However, these tactics do not always work, and many Matses hunters tell of having to defend themselves with shotguns, arrows, or sticks. There have been a few isolated cases of jaguars killing men, women, and children in the forest, and there have been two instances within the last 40 years of a jaguar entering a Matses village and attacking people. Jaguars often kill Matses hunting dogs.</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="52.[108,638,226,1738]" pageId="52">The Matses believe that if one kills, touches, or even looks at a jaguar, the spirit of the jaguar can make their child ill. The principal symptoms of jaguar-induced illness are a fever and constant thirst for water (jaguars are characterized by the Matses as drinking water constantly while eating meat). Several plants known as “jaguar/felid” medicine can be used to cure jaguar sickness. The child is bathed with an infusion of their leaves. If hunter has had contact with or seen a jaguar, he will collect these medicinal plants to treat his children prophylactically.</paragraph>

Jaguars are rarely encountered, but their tracks on river beaches and claw marks on trees are seen frequently. They are especially common on the banks of the Yaquerana (upper Río Yavarí).

Jaguars are nocturnal and diurnal. They travel very far, to other large streams. They spend much of their time walking slowly, searching for prey, or waiting to ambush prey. They sleep in hollow logs, hollow trees, cavities in the banks of stream headwater gullies, or between buttress roots, but not in the open. A jaguar does not sleep in the same place on consecutive nights, unless it is a female that has just given birth to cubs. However, a jaguar may return to a sleeping place after several days or more. Jaguars rest up in trees, in a sunny spot, or in or beside a treefall. Jaguars scratch trees and fallen logs, leaving claw marks that the Matses often find. Tonnad trees (species of

Jaguars also wait for tapirs and other prey at mineral licks. The jaguar also walks where there are no paths. It stalks collared peccaries without rustling the leaves as it walks. It captures the peccary by grabbing it with its claws and biting its head. It does likewise with deer. It ambushes monkeys up in trees. It kills most of its prey by biting the head.

It drinks a lot of water after eating its fill of meat. After drinking, it lies down to rest near its stash. After resting it eats some more. Before it is all done, it hunts again.

REMARKS: Matses observations about jaguars are consistent with an emerging consensus about the distinctive trophic role of these top predators in Amazonian ecosystems. Whereas jaguar diets in subtropical and semiarid landscapes broadly overlap those of sympatric pumas (Taber et al., 1997; Núñez et al., 2000), Amazonian jaguars often eat armored reptiles and large mammals that are seldom taken by pumas. Such prey are thought to be uniquely vulnerable to jaguars because these cats have adaptations for durophagy that allow them to bite through reptilian armor and heavily ossified mammalian skulls (Schaller and Vasconcelos, 1978;

et al., 2016). Other prey commonly taken by Amazonian jaguars, but not (or less often) by other sympatric cats, include aquatic and semiaquatic taxa that jaguars hunt by patrolling river beaches and lakeshores (

The prey species that Matses interviewees report to be eaten by jaguars but not by pumas—notably giant armadillos, giant anteaters, tapirs, adult white-lipped peccaries, capybaras, tortoises, river-turtle eggs, and fish (

)—exemplify both aspects of this hypothetically distinctive niche (defined by durophagy and riparian/aquatic foraging). However, Matses descriptions of jaguar behavior also extend our knowledge of the remarkable predatory abilities of this species, which has not previously been reported to kill tapirs under water. That jaguars routinely patrol trails is well known, but the Matses say that jaguars also hunt in trailless parts of the forest (contra Weckel et al., 2006). An apparently novel observation is occasional frugivory, which seems not to have been reported in any previous analysis of jaguar diets.
