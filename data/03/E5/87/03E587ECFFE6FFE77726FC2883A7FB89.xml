The archaic term for the white-lipped peccary, chede, is monomorphemic and found in some other Mayoruna languages. In the language used in the Matses’ komok ceremony, the white-lipped peccary is called pashankid, a term whose meaning seems to contain the nominalizing suffix -kid, but the meaning of pashan is not clear.</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="83.[108,637,226,1638]" pageId="83">
As with the collared peccary, two varieties are recognized, şhëktenamë çhëşhë (“black” or “dark-colored” white-lipped peccary) and şhëktenamë uşhu (“white” or “light-colored” white-lipped peccary). The dark variety is said to be larger and has a very white jaw, while the lighter variety is said to have a grayish, less contrastingly colored jaw. An additional name is panchu, which uniquely designates the leader of a white-lipped peccary herd.

<paragraph blockId="83.[108,637,226,1638]" pageId="83">White-lipped peccaries are a primary game species for the Matses. The Matses find them while hunting in the forest by smell, or when dogs pick up their scent, or when they are heard grunting or crunching palm nuts. Hunters also find their tracks, or see muddied water flowing downstream from where a herd has foraged in the streambed. White-lipped peccaries are sometimes encountered by canoe travellers, who find herds crossing rivers, see their tracks on the bank where they have crossed, or smell or hear them eating in the forest near the banks. Unless he encounters white-lipped peccaries far from the village, a hunter is expected to refrain from killing them and to return to the village to recruit other men to come and hunt them collectively. If the herd is found at the end of the day, the hunt will begin at dawn the following day.</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="83.[108,637,226,1638]" pageId="83">Matses hunters usually kill white-lipped peccaries with shotguns or arrows. Since there are seldom enough shotguns to arm all the men in a village, bows and arrows are still used in these collective hunts.

]). If it is a very large herd, the peccaries may not run off when hunters start to kill them, defending themselves by trying to bite the hunters. In such cases the Matses can easily kill many individuals, although hunters may have to climb trees if they are attacked. If the peccaries run off, as is most frequently the case, the hunters will chase after them. Because white-lipped peccaries do not run quickly and can be headed off, they are easily killed, and one can even get right next to them while running and kill them with a spear or club. When the leader of the herd is killed, the peccaries run aimlessly, often circling back toward the hunters. When clubbed on the head, right where its ears are, the peccary dies immediately.
</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="83.[684,1214,226,1738]" pageId="83">Dogs are also used to hunt white-lipped peccaries. Dogs can help tire out the peccaries, giving the hunters a chance to catch up, if the herd had a good head start. Additionally, a white-lipped peccary that is chased by a dog may stop, turn to face the dog, and try to bite it. If the hunter can catch up in time, he kills the peccary. However, dogs are often bitten during such hunts.</paragraph>
<paragraph blockId="83.[684,1214,226,1738]" pageId="83">White-lipped peccaries are considered potentially dangerous, and any children present during a hunt are told to climb trees in case the peccaries become fierce. Baby whitelipped peccaries are often captured during hunts and kept as pets, although captive animals become fierce as adults and must be kept in a pen. White-lipped peccary hides could formerly be sold legally, so the Matses used to prepare them for sale, but only collared peccary hides are purchased now. Some hunters smoke white-lipped peccary meat for sale at nearby non-Indian towns.</paragraph>

When the Matses kill some of them, the rest of the herd travels very far away and comes back only after a very long time. They travel slowly when there are many recently born young. They go around looking for fallen tree fruits and fallen palm nuts that they crunch loudly. They follow streams rooting in the floodplain earth for earthworms and digging into the streambed looking for mollusks and crustaceans. They make the water turbid where they dig into streambeds. They leave a wide path where they travel and leave large cleared areas where they have rooted.
