The structure of the pouch and its lobes in this species is—as compared to the other species of this subgenus—unexpectedly complex. It is not completely clear how the very narrow cavities of the pouch are connected and on which ways the secretions produced in the lobes can pass into the pit. Histological sectioning or microtomography studies will be necessary to clarify these questions. The system can be seen as a preadaptation for the development of the pouch structure present in the
