). At the end of spermiogenesis, four slender spermatids arrange closely attached to each other. The main cell components coil within the cell membrane, while the cellular bridges widen and secondarily surround the main sperm cell components. The fused sperm are the subject to several differentiations including partial restriction of common cytoplasm and further coiling processes, before large sperm conjugates are released into the lumen of the testis (
