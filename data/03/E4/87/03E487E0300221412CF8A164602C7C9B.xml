). At the end of spermiogenesis four spermatids fuse and form large and voluminous synspermia. During early stages of this sperm conjugation, four mainly individualized spermatids that remained connected to each other via cellular bridges arrange in close association. While the Ax’s, as well as peN’s coil, and form the massive bulge of early bottle-shaped synspermia, the cellular bridges widen posteriorly resulting in a large amount of common cytoplasm. Finally, the common cytoplasm, which contains numerous mitochondria, encases the spermatids secondarily during further differentiation of the sperm conjugate.
