One purpose of this paper is to outline the reasons for the marked departures from previously accepted restorations made in preparing the B.M. (N.H.) exhibit. The following aspects of this skeletal reconstruction and its posture are contested: the length of the tail, the angle of the vertebral column, and the positioning of the limbs and skull.

If the skull were articulated on the vertebral column as restored by Osborn the occipitalcondylewould not have been in full articulation with the atlas. In fact, the skull was supported on a well-defined cervical region and at a marked angle to the rest of the column (

Haemal arches on the caudal vertebrae have been taken as evidence that the tail was dragged along the ground, and are alleged to have had a protective function. Their presence as far forward as the second and third caudal vertebrae makes this difficult to accept, since it is hardly likely that the proximal part of the tail made contact with the ground and thus protection from abrasion was unnecessary. Moreover, the footprints of carnivorous dinosaurs give little indication that the tail was dragged along the ground. Although the American restoration indicates a very flexible tail, with appropriate short zygopophysesfor the distal caudal vertebrae, in the comparable

To work out the functioning of the hind-limb it is useful to consider the living flightless birds, where the femur is shorter than the tibia and is held forward of the acetabulum. As there is no tail to act as a counter-balance, this orientation of the femur serves to bring forward the centre of gravity. In 
<taxonomicName authorityName="Osborn" authorityYear="1905" box="[1042,1298,2088,2132]" class="Reptilia" family="Tyrannosauridae" genus="Tyrannosaurus" higherTaxonomySource="GBIF" kingdom="Animalia" order="Dinosauria" pageId="1" pageNumber="3" phylum="Chordata" rank="genus">

the femur is longer than the tibia and the limb could not have borne the stresses if it were held horizontally. In fact, the presence of the heavy tail would have brought back the centre of gravity of the animal and made the horizontal position of the femur unnecessary. When walking, the weight of the animal must have been borne by one leg at a time alternately, and in birds and carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs comparable specializations are found. In both groups the major axis through the articular surface of the proximal end of the femur is at a marked angle to that of the distal end. When the animal supports its weight on one leg, the distal articular surface of the femur rolls out laterally, thus tightening the ligament between the great trochanter and the cnemial crest. This results in the kneejoint being moved laterally outwards and the animal’s weight being transferred sideways so that the centre of gravity lies over the limb, the tightened ligament preventing excess dexure.

as the free limb swung forwards the tail would have swung laterally away from it, whilst the femur would be drawn through a restricted arc and the main part of the stride accomplished by the movement at the knee-joint. The large procnemial crest on the anterior surface of the proximal part of the tibia would be suitable for the insertion of tendonous tissue for the attachment of muscles providing leverage for pulling the lower part of the limb forwards. As the limb was bent and the ankle joint flexed, the tendons along the posterior surface of the limb connecting the tibia and fibula to the more distal elements would have been stretched, resulting in the clenching of the toes as in birds. This would allow the foot to clear the ground as the limb swung forwards.

Since the weight must have been carried by each limb in turn, the gait is likely to have been sinuous, producing a bird-like waddling, and the series of megalosaurian footprints from the Purbeck Beds (Upper Jurassic) of Swanage now on display in the Dinosaur Gallery at the British Museum (Natural History) confirm this view. The individual footprints do not lie in a straight line and the toes point inwards, indicating that the animal was pigeon-toed. The stride was small (some 25 1/2 inches) in relation to the size of the animal's foot (12 inches). A detailed map of the trackway reveals an overall sinuous curve and seems to confirm the essentially bird-like gait of these animals, whilst the shortness of the stride further confirms the restricted amount of posteroanterior movement at the acetabulum.

The role of the fore-limbs was that of a brake holding the body, so that the force exerted by the extension of the hind-limbs was transmitted to the pelvic region, thus pushing it upwards. The fore-limbs would have assisted in the initial stages of lifting the trunk region off the ground.</paragraph>

From a resting position the animal's first action in rising would be to raise the head and at the same time begin to straighten the fore-limbs (

The muscles from the ventral and lateral caudal regions and the ischia, acting on the femora, served to assist the extension of the hind-limbs and helped to maintain equilibrium, the centre of gravity being maintained at a line through the ankle and knee-joints and the anterior end of the sacrum.

Owing to the acute angles adopted by the femorae and tibiae when the animal was at rest, there must have been considerable lateral forces acting on the knee-joints and tending to force them outwards, in which case there would have been great difficulty in flexing the legs. However, any tendency for a knee-joint to be forced outwards was prevented by a condyle, situated behind the outer articular surface of the distal end of the femur, this occupied the space between the fibula and tibia when the knee was fully bent, as shown in
