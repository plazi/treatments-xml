Although Harding gives particulars of the male claspers and outline figures of the second trunk limbs of both sexes, no details of trunk limb armature have ever been recorded. This armature is very striking and is a key feature relating to the animal‚Äôs way of life. The gut contents of preserved specimens consist largely of what can be described as fine sand and organic debris. The only recognizable objects seen were a few pennate diatoms. Clearly much inorganic material is scraped from the bottom and

These, one per segment, and lacking on a few segments, taper gradually to a sharp point. There is a more slender spine at the tip of the distal segment. If the exopodite is flexed, these spines project. They possibly serve to obtain purchase, or to anchor the animal, as it employs its scraping limbs, but this is only conjecture. The male bears spines on both rami, which does not negate this suggestion but implies another function in that sex.</paragraph>

Such a view shows the gradation in size of the limbs, largest anteriorly; how the four posterior limbs make up only a small part of the ensemble; how the distal (ventral) endites of the limbs, which have access to the surfaces from which food is collected, bear a numerous array of scraping spines; how, more proximally, the median face of the ensemble is largely covered by a screen of long slender setae (the screening setae), through which numerous postero-dorsally directed spines of the proximal endites can project into the narrow median cage between opposed sets of limbs; and how the gnathobases of the limbs lie in line, one behind the other, along the length of the straight food groove.

Limbs 11 and 12 are very small. The trunk limbs lie more or less as at the end of promotion. Of particular note is that, except on the distal scraper-bearing endites, and at the extreme posterior end, the median face of the limbs is covered by a screen of posteriorly and somewhat dorsally directed setae. The gnathobases of the seven anterior limbs are conspicuous: more posterior gnathobases less easily seen. Note how the cuticle-lined food groove, here torn away over much of its length, widens greatly into a ‚Äòbasin‚Äô in the vicinity of the first three gnathobases. Trunk limb 12, detached from the right hand series, is present at bottom right. Except that the gnathobase lies proximally its orientation bears no relation to that in life. Scale bar 500 Mm. B, distal elements of gnathobases 4‚Äì6, seen within the confines of the food groove (FG). Note the stout denticulated spines that sweep food material forward (here to the left), the smooth curved spines (SCS) that are directed posteriorly, and the long, posteriorly directed, soft retaining setae (RS), of which the anteriormost extends posteriorly across the two gnathobases posterior to it. The tips of many screening setae, of which those seen anteriorly are clogged with screened out detritus, are readily seen. Note how the cuticle that lines the food groove reflects segmentation. The segments, of which parts of four are represented, increase in length from posterior to anterior. Scale bar 100 Mm.

Although this probably cannot be observed even in the living animals ‚Äì scrapers are minute, and the limbs that bear them move rapidly, are largely hidden within the carapace and are just one part of a complex armature of spines and setae ‚Äì it is evident that each is capable of considerable movement at its articulated base. Simple movements of spines and setae at their basal articulation are common in crustaceans and are often easily permitted by flexible cuticle. More complex movements are possible as a result of elaboration of the cuticular articulation which, as in notostracan branchiopods, may involve a thickened ring of cuticle on which the spine rests. Further elaboration by modifications such as the development of a boss against which the base of the spine can rest during the working stroke, and of a pedicel of flexible cuticle which allows the spine to move with considerable latitude is seen in the notostracan

). Moreover, the members of a series often follow a pattern that is common in such devices in which there is a graded succession from coarse to fine scrapers. The coarse scrapers pass over the substratum first and are able to dislodge relatively large and perhaps attached, particles, while that last member or members of the series are not only longer but more finely toothed and comb or sweep up particles left behind by their more coarsely toothed companions (

). This can be called the scrape and sweep arrangement and can apply to scrapers borne on a single limb or on successive limbs. However, this is not inevitably the case. Fine-toothed scrapers may precede coarser scrapers during the swing of a limb. This is so on some of the endopodites. Here long, coarsely armed distal scrapers extend posteriorly beyond the range of action of more proximal, sometimes shorter, fine-toothed scrapers. Material swept medially and towards the food groove by the distal scrapers during one cycle of movement is brought to a position from which it can be swept further by the fine-toothed scrapers of the assemblage behind during the next cycle. Both this and the scrape and sweep arrangement can be seen here as distal, coarsely toothed scrapers are followed by even more distally and laterally located fine, comblike scrapers on the same limb.

Because the trunk limbs are not flat but are complicated three-dimensional structures, arrays of scrapers do not simply lie in line one behind the other, but are inserted on curved surfaces at different levels. The movement of a limb is not just a stereotyped backward and forward beat: it involves flexion and extension. Moreover, as described below, individual endites are capable of independent movements. The versatility of a scraping/sweeping limb is therefore considerable, and the ability to make fine adjustments by moving endites independently of each other is an advanced condition in a phyllopodous limb. It also demands a high level of co-ordination between adjacent limbs. Impressive co-ordination is apparent even in resting laevicaudatans and must be vastly greater in

It is also more complicated than that of most anostracans with their 11, or occasionally more, pairs of homonomous trunk limbs, at least when they employ them for extracting suspended particles. Even in anomopod branchiopods in which individual limbs of great complexity co-operate with others of very different structure to make an intricate device, versatility of a single limb is essentially limited to the first two pairs and is of a restricted nature. Only the second trunk limb of such anomopods as employ it for scraping food from surfaces rivals the limbs of

Movements of the limbs are not confined to swings of the entire appendage. Individual endites, particularly the elongate distal members, and the endopodite, can be flexed. This swings them, and their armature of scrapers and other spines, posteriorly and dorsally, i.e. towards the food groove, and gives subtlety to the movements of their batteries of scrapers, and facilitates the transfer of collected material to the median chamber and ultimately to the food groove. On endite 2 of at least limbs 4‚Äì6 there is a fold of cuticle that presumably facilitates some flexing within the endite as the limb moves. It can be seen in

Anteriorly, powerful extrinsic muscles (EP) originating in the trunk insert about halfway along the anterior margin. Their contraction promotes the limb by pulling its anterior region towards the trunk. This is facilitated by a wedge-shaped region near the base of the limb (

) on whose inner face the cuticle is thinner than that adjacent to it, and whose outer face appears to be covered over a more extensive surface with thin cuticle. The cuticle of this wedge clearly concertinas, and the angle of the wedge becomes more acute, when the extrinsic promotor muscles contract. The thin outer cuticle presumably also facilitates flexing in this region as the limb remotes and the endites move towards the food groove.

Other extrinsic muscles have roles that are less easy to elucidate. Muscle EA, a closely associated narrower muscle (EB) and muscle EC, which inserts more distally, probably assist remotion of the limb in different ways in collaboration with muscle ER.

Such a joint is unusual in phyllopodial appendages but is known in the first trunk limb of notostracans, where, however, the cuticle is much thicker. Extension of the endopodite is achieved particularly by means of two well-developed intrinsic extensor muscles (1 and 2) that originate more proximally in the corm. Although these have poor mechanical advantage they are stout, and their load when the endopodite spines participate in scraping is probably seldom great. A very small muscle (3), whose role is uncertain, conceivably helps to flex the endopodite, but has no homologue in adjacent endites. A larger muscle (4) is also problematic. It originates on the margin of the limb and seems not to be involved in moving the endopodite. There appear to be no flexors of the endopodite, and certainly none to fulfil this role in adjacent endites. In a phyllopodial limb it would be no surprise to find haemocoelic pressure responsible for the extension of a trunk limb element, but here it is flexion that appears to lack the necessary muscles ‚Äì for which such pressure appears unsuitable. Cuticular elasticity is a possible answer.</paragraph>

That of endite 5 (muscle 5a) is part of a larger muscle (5) that originates on the transverse apodeme (TA) near the middle of the limb, the function of whose major component is unclear. It may serve as a brace. The extensor (6) of endite 4 also originates on the apodeme. No flexors are present. Endite 3 (E3), which is very different in shape, has a similar extensor muscle (7) to that of endite 4, which suggests that is it capable of a little independent movement, although this is probably small. Muscle 8 superficially suggests it may have a similar function to muscles 5, 6 and 7 and may move endite 2 (E2) slightly, but in fact it originates on the transverse apodeme (TA) and, like its more robust companion, muscle 9, which does likewise, runs obliquely dorsally and anteriorly.

More distally they become progressively longer. Most are stout, but the three distalmost, which are the longest, are finely toothed and over-reach and sweep up material dislodged by their shorter, more robust companions. The distalmost spine in the series is smooth. The short, finely toothed proximal scrapers are suitably located to sweep material brought within reach by distal scrapers of the assemblage in front during the previous cycle. Scale bar 100 Mm.

Near its base is a sensilla. Between the other two conspicuous elements can just be seen the basal portion of the second stout denticulate spine. This lies more laterally, i.e. nearer to the food groove wall, at a deeper level of focus in the darkness of the food groove. Anterior to the posterior denticulate spine is a smooth spine and, anterior to that, a robust sweeping spine with a reflexed distal portion that bears long spinules. The flexure is probably not an artefact (cf. trunk limb 9, Fig. 5B). The distal part of this spine is partly obscured by the long setules of an adjacent sweeping seta (cf. trunk limb 9, Fig. 5B).

Similarity to a filter is enhanced by the pilosity of the faces of endites 2 and 3, whose component setules are directed posteriorly and dorsally towards the food groove. These perhaps help to clean the screening setae and ensure that the particles pass to the food groove, but they are not cleaning setules of the kind that clean filters in some filter-feeding crustaceans.

Material swept posteriorly and dorsally, and towards the midline, by the food-collecting scrapers of the distal endites and endopodite comes within reach of the posteriorly directed stout spines of endites 2 and 3, of which those on endite 3 are often serrated distally. As each limb becomes flexed posteriorly during the working phase of the cycle of movement (remotion), these spines also swing posteriorly and, towards the end of the cycle, ever more dorsally, and push the collected material towards the food groove. Escape laterally into the inter-limb spaces is prevented by the screening setae on each side. Towards the posterior end of the trunk limb series, as limbs diminish in size, the endites become shorter and the distal endites more similar in shape to endites 2 and 3.

A, armature of the four posterior trunk limbs as seen in an individual in which they are fortuitously twisted towards the mid line. Proximally the four gnathobases are seen close together, that of limb 11 being jammed between those of limbs 10 and 12. The more distal armature of this limb is largely obscured by that of adjoining limbs. Being the last of the series, with nothing to obscure it posteriorly, trunk limb 12 clearly displays its gnathobase and endites 2‚Äì5. Its endopodite is largely obscured by endite 5 but some of its spinous armature can be seen arising from behind that endite. The arrangement of the armature of the endites of this limb facilitates understanding of that of the three more anterior limbs where, especially in limbs 9 and 10, it is seen ‚Äòfull face‚Äô and it is difficult to see where that of one endite ends and that of the next begins. That the more proximal armature of all these limbs consists largely of stout spines, sometimes curved near their tips to enable them to drag material towards the food groove, is readily seen. More distally, especially on limbs 9 and 10, the armature of endite 4 includes many stout hook-like spines (for details see Fig. 8B). The posterior limits of the grid setae, which do not cover the apparatus seen here, are seen to the left (anterior) of the illustration. Scale bar 100 Mm. B, details of the distal endites of trunk limbs 9 and 10 seen at greater magnification. The fifth and fourth endites of limbs 9 and 10, seen face on, have a broad posterior ‚Äòmargin‚Äô, in each case provided with an armature of highly specialized spines of great diversity. On endite 5 the spines extend somewhat obliquely to facilitate the ‚Äòembracing‚Äô of masses of food material. Those of the anterior margin of limb 9 are scrapers that differ somewhat from orthodox scrapers and have hook-like tips. These perhaps serve to sweep and push rather than scrape surfaces, to which access is less easy than for anterior limbs, but their exact role cannot be defined. More distally and posteriorly are hook-like spines of various types and sizes that clearly drag in collected material or, in the case of very large distal hooks, retain it, and there are more hook-like spines internal to the scrapers. On endite 4, a dense and diverse array of hook-like spines and a few small denticulate spines are well suited to passing material proximally. The distal armature of endite 5 of trunk limb 10, while extending outwards so that the entire ensemble forms a scoop, is quite different. Whereas the distalmost spines can clearly scrape and sweep, their close companions bear diverging marginal rows of denticles, well suited to scooping and sweeping masses of material proximally to a region functionally continuous with endite 4, like which it is armed with a profusion of hooks. The large spiniform spines seen on the extreme right are of trunk limb 12. Much of limb 11 is here hidden between this limb and limb 10. These limbs also pass material proximally. Scale bar 50 Mm.

), the anteriormost is curved so as to be directed posteriorly. Although the denticulate spines clearly play a major role in pushing food material anteriorly, the curved spine must inevitably lift material slightly from the food groove as the gnathobase swings backward on promotion of the limb. There must clearly be some advantage in this: perhaps ensuring that material does not clog the food groove and lifting it towards the denticulate spines in readiness for their next working sweep.

are not suited to a function that involves sweeping or beating. They are too soft and delicate, and their setules too long and soft for this. It is suggested that, lying as they do in pairs, they form a ‚Äòblanket‚Äô beneath the food groove, which is open ventrally, and may help to prevent material escaping from it during promotion of the limb when the gnathobase makes its return swing. Their flaccid nature probably allows them to bend near their base and allow distal portions to remain covering the contents of the food groove. We suggest that they be termed retaining setae. Their softness and pliability and the orientation of their setules are such that they must easily be pushed aside by particles entering the food groove anywhere along its length. In the position occupied by such a seta on other limbs, trunk limb 1 carries a short, stouter seta.

Note how the cuticle-lined food groove, here torn away over much of its length, widens greatly into a ‚Äòbasin‚Äô in the vicinity of the first three gnathobases. Trunk limb 12, detached from the right hand series, is present at bottom right. Except that the gnathobase lies proximally its orientation bears no relation to that in life. Scale bar 500 Mm. B, distal elements of gnathobases 4‚Äì6, seen within the confines of the food groove (FG). Note the stout denticulated spines that sweep food material forward (here to the left), the smooth curved spines (SCS) that are directed posteriorly, and the long, posteriorly directed, soft retaining setae (RS), of which the anteriormost extends posteriorly across the two gnathobases posterior to it. The tips of many screening setae, of which those seen anteriorly are clogged with screened out detritus, are readily seen. Note how the cuticle that lines the food groove reflects segmentation. The segments, of which parts of four are represented, increase in length from posterior to anterior. Scale bar 100 Mm.

The face of each ridge is also provided with a number of much smaller, short, stout, stud-like denticles located mostly near its anterior and posterior margins, and with small, blunt denticles near the middle of each.

Because the denticles of the ridges project towards their partners, it seems unlikely that the mandibles can do much grinding, or indeed that their molar surfaces can ever have close contact with each other. On the other hand, opposed denticles can probably grip relatively large items, perhaps even wider than the band of ridges, and can evidently cope with the fine sand grains of which many are ingested, which it is impossible for a substratum scraper to avoid in desert ponds. The robustness of the denticles is perhaps as much an adaptation to a ubiquitous substratum as to the handling of a particular kind of food. Smaller sand particles can doubtless fit into the gap between the opposed mandibles where the small stud-like denticles offer protection to the cuticular surface. The stout teeth of other species of
