Elytra twice as broad as long, somewhat more than twice as long as prothorax (4: 1.7), broadest at apical third, arcuate on sides from base to about caudal fourth, but slightly interrupted at about basal third where ninth interval joins seventh, thence constricted, lateral outline made by seventh interval, outline thence continued and bluntly rounded by outer interval; striae about as broad as intervals, their punctures coarse; first two intervals plain, first with a few granules near apex, interval 3 elevated from base to apex and bearing a row of granules in caudal third and a few near base, 4 plain, not reaching past caudal fourth, 5 elevated from a distance about equal to space between it and third interval and terminating well before apex of 7, and bearing granules on elevated part, 4 and 5 not distinct individually at base, 6 more or less partially obliterated by punctures of adjoining intervals,
