, and Pseudomyrma, i.e., with the head on the ventral side. The head is surrounded by a cluster of prominent, tubercle-like appendages. On the prothorax, which is large and forms a hood over the head, there are three pairs of these appendages, an anterior truncate pair, a median pointed pair and a large posterior pair, which are swollen and rounded and embrace the sides of the head. These correspond to the single prothoracic pair figured in the larva of

. The mesothoracic segment has a pair of smaller appendages nearer the midventral line. Between them arises a very peculiar organ, with a swollen, pear-shaped base prolonged into a slender, apparently erectile, tentacle-like process which extends up in front of the head and terminates in a small ampulla. The first abdominal segment bears a pair of large swollen appendages, which lie at the lateral bases of the mesothoracic pair and are united with a large and very prominent midventral tubercle. This tubercle and its lateral appendages are represented in the larva of 
<taxonomicName id="14F425DE1E857F626FEBA60FD0EDAA07" LSID-HNS="urn:lsid:biosci.ohio-state.edu:osuc_concepts:160184" authority="Wheeler" authorityName="Wheeler" class="Hexapoda" family="Formicidae" genus="Viticicola" higherTaxonomySource="GBIF" kingdom="Animalia" lsidName-HNS="Viticicola tessmanni (Stitz)" order="Hymenoptera" pageNumber="116" phylum="Arthropoda" rank="species" species="tessmanni">V. tessmanni</taxonomicName>
but the others, with the exception of the third thoracic pair, are absent. Sections and stained, cleared preparations of the whole larva show that the various tubercles contain portions of the fat-body, at least in the basal portions of their cavities, and next to the hypodermis a dense, granular substance, evidently a coagulated liquid produced by the adipocytes or trophocytes. The liquid also fills the impaired tentacle, except its pear-shaped base, which contains fat-cells. Around the bases of the tubercles are muscles so arranged that their contraction increases the pressure of the fat and granular liquid on the appendages and in all probability causes the liquid to exude through the hypodermis and delicate chitinous cuticle onto the surface. The whole arrangement of the tubercles, in fact, constitutes a system of exudate organs or &quot;exudatoria,&quot; as I shall call them, adapted to produce a substance that can be licked up by the ants when they are feeding and caring for the larvae. In this stage the mandibles are small, soft, and unchitinized, so that the ants must feed the larva by regurgitation on liquid food. The labium of the larva has a peculiar pair of swollen appendages, shown just beneath the mandibles in the figure. The body is naked, except for a few sparse, pointed bristles on the dorsal surface and the median pair of prothoracic appendages. As nothing like this larval stage is known among ants or indeed among the Hymenoptera, I propose to call it the &quot;trophidium.&quot;

The body is more elliptical, the mandibles are more pointed and distinctly falcate but, even in this stage, they are unchitinized and therefore nonfunctional. The coarse hairs are visible on the dorsal surface but a more uniform investment of small hairs has made its appearance. They are blunt or even clavate, especially on the prothoracic segment. In this and the trophidium stage, I am unable to find any salivary glands in cleared preparations, though rudiments of these organs may, perhaps, be present.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="7333FE984B39892A808171DF17CEB9A2" pageNumber="118">The third stage larva (Fig. 27b) is larger and very regularly elliptical. The exudatoria can all be recognized, except the impaired tentacle. It is, however, present in some of the younger individuals but in a greatly reduced and vestigial condition at the bottom of the deep depression which now forms a definite pocket just back of the mouth and under the midventral swelling of the first abdominal segment. In many larvae I found in this pocket a small rounded, dark-colored pellet which puzzled me at first. In sections it was at once seen to consist of triturated and compacted bodies and parts of small insects. It is, in fact, a food-pellet placed by the worker ants in the pocket just behind the larva's mouth and proves to be merely the pellet which is originally formed in the infrabuccal pocket of the adult ants. In this stage, therefore, the larva is fed on solid food and the strongly chitinized, acute, and bidentate mandibles corroborate this statement. Slender salivary glands may also be detected in this stage indicating that the substance of the food-pellet is subjected to extra-intestinal digestion. The longer hairs on the dorsal integument have almost completely disappeared. The first pair of appendages on the prothorax have disappeared and the second pair is smaller or obsolescent.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="A45CB4D0632238D13E35816E6AA2D21B" pageNumber="118">In the fourth or adult stage (Fig. 27c) the larva is more elongate and cylindrical and much more hypocephalic, the prothorax forming a great protuberance in front of the head. The exudatoria are still recognizable, with the exception of the first and second prothoracic pairs, which have disappeared completely. The labial appendages are reduced. A food-pellet was found in the postcephalic pocket in several of the larvae of this stage but is not represented in the figure. The coarse hairs have disappeared from the integument, which is now uniformly covered with very short, delicate hairs and the structure of the posterior end of the body is very different from that of the preceding stages.</paragraph>

(vide infra) are that the young larvae are fed by regurgitation, the older larvae with pellets of crushed insects, and that, especially during their younger stages, the larvae are so assiduously fed and cared for because they furnish liquid exudates, small in quantity, to be sure, but of such a quality as to excite the appetite of their nurses and induce regurgitation. I believe that the salivary glands, as soon as they develop, take on the function of supplying exudates and at the same time aid in the extra-intestinal digestion of the food placed in the postcephalic pocket. That the salivary glands may be important as exudate organs throughout life is indicated by certain genera of Myrmicinae (e. g., 
<taxonomicName id="8B13E392C55F6E69F6C5EC4ECD5C264B" LSID-HNS="urn:lsid:biosci.ohio-state.edu:osuc_concepts:24892" class="Insecta" family="Formicidae" genus="Paedalgus" kingdom="Animalia" lsidName-HNS="Paedalgus Forel" order="Hymenoptera" pageNumber="119" phylum="Arthropoda" rank="genus">Paedalgus</taxonomicName>
), the larvae of which have no exudatoria but greatly developed salivary glands, though the latter are never used for spinning cocoons in the prepupal stage. Thus in ants very much the same &quot;oecotrophobiotic&quot; relations exist between the adults and young as Roubaud1 has so beautifully described for the wasps of the genera Belonogaster, Ropalidia (= Icaria), and Polistes. To these relations, established by a mutual exchange of food-substances and which I have called &quot;trophallactic,&quot; the social life of ants in all probability owes its origin, development, and maintenance. Moreover, the exudates of larval ants are strictly comparable with those of various castes of termites among themselves, of the queens of parasitic ants and even of workers (e. g.,

of the East Indies), with the excrement of coccids and aphids, the secretions of lycaenid larvae and the nectar of the extrafloral nectaries of plants. Thus trophallaxis, myrmecophily, termitophily, trophobiosis, and the relations of ants with certain plants (myrmecophytes) are all seen to be merely so many particular manifestations of the same fundamental instinct of ants to foster and defend and, if possible, to feed and transport any small living object which can furnish droplets of agreeable secretion or exudates.
