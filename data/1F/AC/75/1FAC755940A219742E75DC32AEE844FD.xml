was found only in the lowlands of Corcovado National Park. ridges or hills are apparently not colonized by the species. ln leaf litter mean densities are about 5 individuals/mz. but mav reach up to 12 individuals/ mz. if large amounts of appropriate dead rolled leaves where females build their nests are available. Females guard the eggs and young against predators and defend the nests and the area around it against conspecific females. Egg clutches (3 - 5 eggs) are laid successively and up to 15 clutches were counted in a single nest. Females stay with the nests for months and hunt in close vicinity to it. Eggs hatch after about two weeks. iuveniles leave the nest after another two weeks. The spiders prey mainly on collembola (40 Z). small ants are taken also (25 Z). as well as other small insects. Males wander in search of females. the distance covered may be up to 15 m per day in more or less one direction.
</paragraph>
<paragraph pageId="0" pageNumber="-1">lf males encounter other conspecific males they display agonisticly which includes embracing. grappling and pushing. The opponents move to within a close distance of each other and begin to wave the first two pairs of legs creating a fan (fig. 1).</paragraph>

<paragraph pageId="0" pageNumber="-1">The frequency of waving may be up to 2 to 3 waves per second. The body is held up straight, supported by the two hind pairs of legs and the palpi hang downward. Leg waving is aided by lowering and raising of the body. The body is lowered to the ground by bending the third pair of legs. In this position the chelicerae almost touch the ground. then the body is raised explosively and the first two pairs of legs are stretched outward as much as possible when the cephalothorax reaches its highest position.</paragraph>
<paragraph pageId="0" pageNumber="-1">Males show a distinct courtship behaviour which is very different compared to the agonistic display. After visual contact with a female. males lift the first and often second legs as well. The femora are held against the cephalothorax and the tibiae and tarsi are bent inwards so that the tarsi approach each other (fig. 2). The palpi are lifted and retracted in front of the chelicerae and the cephalothorax is raised. Further approaches towards the female are performed by zig-zag-dancing. Females raise the front legs towards the males and vibrate the legs up and down. then turn away raising the cephalothorax to maximum height, abdomen almost touching the ground and turn around slowly in front of the male (360 °) as if to show themselves to the males (fig. 2). Female palpi are lifted as high as possible with the palpal femora held against the front edge of the cephalothorax and the palpal tibiae held straight forward in front of the ALE like horns. Copulation takes place outside or inside the nest. Outside the nest courtship is performed visually. inside the nest it is performed with vibratory signals. Cohabitation of males in nests of subadult females takes place. The species is active during all months of the year. even at the peak of the rainy season.</paragraph>
