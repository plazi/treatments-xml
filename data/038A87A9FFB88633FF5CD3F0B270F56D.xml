These bite-force estimates make it possible to evaluate speculations on tyrannosaur tooth strength and potential behaviours using comparisons with extant taxa. The largest m aximum bite force measureme nts or estimates for extant vertebrates at posterior tooth positions are: 550 N for labrador dogs9, 749 N for humans10, 1,412 N for wolves11, 1,446 N for dusky sharks (location of force measurement within jaw not given)n, 1,712 N for orangutans1.1, 4,168 for lions11, and 13,300 N for American alligators14 (K.

The forces increased with increasing penetration depth even after the cortical layer had been perforated and the underlying cancellous bone was being crushed. The increase in force with penetration depth is attributed to a greater cortical surface area coming into contact with the semi-conical penetrator tooth as it descended through the ilia.
