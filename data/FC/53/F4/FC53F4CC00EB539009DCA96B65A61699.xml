Surface ornamentation of somites consisting of 92 pairs and seven unpaired (mid-dorsal) pores and sensilla (numbered with Arabic numerals consecutively from anterior to posterior end of body, and from dorsal to ventral side in Figs 1B, 2A, B, 3F; but illustrated in more detail for male specimens, see Figs 4, 5, 6); no spinules except on anal somite, caudal rami, and appendages. Habitus (Fig. 1A) relatively robust, not dorso-ventrally compressed, with prosome/urosome length ratio 1.3 and greatest width in dorsal view at posterior end of cephalothorax. Body length/width ratio about 3 (dorsal view); cephalothorax 2.1 times as wide as genital double-somite. Free pedigerous somites without lateral or dorsal expansions, all connected by well developed arthrodial membranes and all with narrow and smooth hyaline fringes. Pleural areas of cephalothorax and free pedigerous somites relatively well developed, covering insertions of cephalic appendages and praecoxae and partly covering coxae of swimming legs in lateral view.
