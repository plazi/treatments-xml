; weight 2-5 kg. Smaller on islands, notably Borneo. A small civet with a dark mask and long tail. The coat color is gray, grayish-brown or rusty; the body spots and stripes are brown or black. The head pattern is very variable, but generally consists of a dark mask, with white or pale gray patches below the eyes, on the forehead, and at the bases of the ears. Variations include: a muzzle with white nose patches, ear and forehead patches that are fused, facial patches that are very small, and facial patterns that are absent or very faint. The rhinarium is large and has a deep groove in the middle. There are black spots along the back that merge to form three lines, which run longitudinally from the shoulders to the base of the tail. The spots on the flanks are well separated, but tend to be in rows. This pattern is variable and can be obscure in some populations; on Borneo and the 
<collectingCountry box="[1640,1797,1561,1594]" name="Philippines" pageId="22" pageNumber="220">Philippines</collectingCountry>
, the whole body can be dark brown or black, and the stripe pattern is indistinguishable. In the northern parts of the range, the length of the guard hairs seems to vary seasonally; when the pelage is long, the coat pattern tendsto be faint. Some individuals have faint rings at the base of the tail, and the tail tip can sometimes be white or yellow. The feet have five digits. The metapodial pads are large and not well separated from the plantar pads. They cover the whole sole and the area between them is naked. On the hindfoot, the third and fourth digit pads are fused at their base. The perineal gland is simple and consists of a naked elongated area. There are three pairs of teats, but the third pair is reduced. The skull is long and low, with prominent post-orbital processes, low crests, a rising rather than flat zygomatic arch, and a marked post-orbital constriction. The posterior chamber of the auditory bullae is ovoid and extends anteriorly, covering largely the anterior chamber. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The carnassials have reduced shearing blades. Sometimes the upper carnassial is short and triangular, with a strong postlingual cingulum; it also can be elongated and narrower, with a reduced post-lingual cingulum. The shape of the premolars and molars is variable. The first premolars are reduced; the second and third premolars are rather simple and pointed. The teeth of old individuals are often very worn.

, 193 scats contained 85% fruits; insects, molluscs, small reptiles, birds, and small mammals were also included in the diet. The major source of fruit was Coffea benghalensis (from mid-December to February) and Bridelia stipularis (in March and April). All scats contained fruits during the fruiting seasons. When ripe fruits were not available, the diet shifted to small vertebrates and invertebrates. Field observations showed that they also fed on the nectar of Bombax ceiba and sap from the stems of Vallaris solanacea. In

<collectingCountry box="[1487,1572,3100,3129]" name="Nepal" pageId="22" pageNumber="220">Nepal</collectingCountry>
, an adult female was active 79% of the time during the hours of darkness, and five other radio-tracked individuals were active from 18:00-04:00 h; they were more active on darker nights, and none of them left their resting sites when there was a full moon. Common Palm Civets rest in trees, choosing the tallest and largest tree in their immediate area at the onset of daylight. They rest more often in trees covered with dense vines (63%) than in trees with holes (21%) or without vines or holes (16%). Trees with vines or holes were used for several consecutive days, but those without these features were not. Common Palm Civets are also known to sleep in buildings. They rest alone, except for females with young. In

<collectingCountry box="[932,1071,1246,1279]" name="Indonesia" pageId="23" pageNumber="230">Indonesia</collectingCountry>

<collectingCountry box="[922,1061,1286,1319]" name="Indonesia" pageId="23" pageNumber="230">Indonesia</collectingCountry>
) and P. h. lignicolor are listed as Threatened in the 1989 IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids. Although widespread and generally considered common (even in disturbed habitats), on Borneo, it was found that the overall density of civets (including this species) in a logged forest was found to be significantly lower than in a primary forest. Common Palm Civets are often considered pests by fruit farmers and are killed. They are also trapped and traded for meat. Common Palm civets are kept as pets and used as rat catchers, which may explain why they were introduced to several areas. They may be under threat on the Mentawai Islands due to forest loss from commercial logging. Field surveys and ecological studies are needed to ascertain their distribution and conservation status, particularly on small islands on which they are known to occur.
