Head-body 46-5-52 cm (males), 46-5—49 cm (females), tail 42-51-6 cm (males), 40-51-6 cm (females), hindfoot 8-9-7 cm (males), 8:2-9-1 cm (females), ear 4-6 cm (males), 4-:2-6-5 cm (females); weight 1:6-2-6 kg (males), 1-4-2-3 kg (females). A medium-sized genet, with a slender body and a long tail. The coat color ranges from whitish-gray to pale yellow-rufous; the underparts are whitish, pale yellowish-gray or gray. The pelage has relatively long guard hairs. In the arid parts ofits range, the pelage is shorter and the coat color and spots are lighter. The head is small, with a pointed muzzle and small, upstanding round ears. The facial mask is relatively well marked, with a dark line on the muzzle and contrasting white sub- and supraocular white spots. The nuchal stripes are well defined. There is a thin, dark mid-dorsal line with long erectile hairs (up to 7-5 cm), which begins after the shoulder and runs to the base of the tail. The dark dorsal spots merge into longitudinal lines. The tail is relatively long, with eight to ten pale rings alternating with dark rings; the tip ofthetail is whitish. The pale rings and the dark rings are the same width, although the margins of the rings are often not clearly distinguishable due to the overlapping long guard hairs of the preceding ring. The fore- and hindlimbs are spotted; the upper parts of the feet are lightly spotted. The underparts of the hindlimb and feet are dark. There are five digits on each foot; the first digits are slightly set back and do not mark in the print. The central depression of the forefeet is hairy. The forefeet have reduced metacarpal pads and the hindfeet bear two very narrow, elongated metatarsal pads. The claws are sharp, curved, and retractile. The perineal gland opens into a longitudinal Y-shaped slit. There are two pairs of teats. The baculum in the male is well-developed. The skull is medium-size and ovoid, with a strong sagittal crest. The rostrum is narrow and elongated. The inter-orbital constriction is weakly marked and the zygomatic arches are lightly built. The post-orbital processes of the frontal and jugal bones are almost totally absent. The auditory bullae are elongated, with the anterior chambers only slightly smaller than the posterior chambers. The premaxillary-frontal contact is absent and the posterior extension of the frontal bones is moderate, overlapping about 50% of the dorsal region of the inter-orbital constriction. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is 1 + 0-12. Dental formula: 1 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The upper canines are elongated, curved and sharp, and the second upper molar and the second lower molars are small. The presence and development of the inner cusp of the third upper premolar is variable. The maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusp of P°.

Occurs in a wide range of habitats. Often associated with trees and bushes, but can also be found in rocky, treeless areas. Seems to avoid dense rainforest and very arid zones, but can be found in close proximity to human dwellings. In 
<collectingCountry box="[2435,2561,1584,1617]" name="Morocco" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Morocco</collectingCountry>
, the Common Genet is found in forests and bushy areas (mainly in the mountains), rocky ravines (preferably vegetated and near water), and in the Sahara fringe (where it is common in oases and other productive areas). In 
<collectingCountry box="[2112,2215,1705,1734]" name="Algeria" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Algeria</collectingCountry>
, it is found in riparian forests at sea level and up to 2000 m in the Djurjura Mountains, where it occupies all types of habitats (most abundant in old forests of Quercus ilex and Cedrus atlantica). In West Africa, it occurs in wooded savannahs. In the Ethiopian Highlands, a radio-collared female was found in woodland (84% of the time), bush (9%), farmland (5%), and grassland (2%). In 
<collectingCountry box="[1688,1816,1898,1931]" name="Tanzania" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Tanzania</collectingCountry>
, Common Genets were camera-trapped in lowland forest. In the Serengeti, they are strongly associated with trees and thickets and are frequently seen on escarpments, rocky outcrops, and other hills. In 
<collectingCountry box="[2227,2360,1985,2010]" name="Botswana" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Botswana</collectingCountry>
, they are found in all the major vegetation associations (including riverine forests and open, dry scrub savannahs): 47 genets were captured in Acacia woodland or scrub, 16 in mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodland or scrub, twelve in Terminalia-Bauhinia scrub, nine in unspecified riverine forests, nine in open grassland (with scattered bushes and trees), and lower numbers in other habitats. The Common Genet does not occur in open habitats unless there is some adjacent scrub cover or isolated patches of trees with underbrush, which suggests that scrub cover or woodland is an essential habitat requirement. In some places, the Common Genet can penetrate into deserts along seasonal watercourses. In Arabia, it is said to inhabit dry ravines in hills and mountains. In Europe, itis especially abundant in oak forests (Quercus spp.) and is also common in olive groves (Olea europaea), riparian copses, ash groves (Fraxinus spp.), pine forests, rocky areas, and scrublands, but is rare or absent in open areas, marshes, and agricultural fields. Common Genets prefer to live at low altitudes, especially in northern areas, which suggests that cold temperatures may restrict its distribution: in central 
<collectingCountry box="[2535,2615,2527,2560]" name="Spain" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Spain</collectingCountry>
, genets were scarce on plateaux and the upper parts of mountains (not found above 1400 m), but were widely distributed in lower mountain areas. They were present in areas with abundant scrub cover and high mean temperatures. In northern 
<collectingCountry box="[2452,2532,2645,2678]" name="Spain" pageId="10" pageNumber="217">Spain</collectingCountry>
, three radio-collared males showed a strong preference for holm oak forest; pine plantations were avoided, eucalyptus plantations were used according to availability, and other habitats such as meadows, gardens, and crops near houses, were used opportunistically by two of the three genets.

<collectingCountry box="[565,644,2186,2211]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, a young female and an adult male both used areas with high ground cover for resting. The diurnal resting sites were located in dense thickets (86% in the young female, 36% in the male) and in treetops (14% and 64%, respectively). When both were available, they usually selected thickets. In treetops, they generally used old bird nests, pine-needle tufts, and dry pine branches, 4-15 m above the ground. Restsites changed each day. The mean distance between consecutive daybeds was 277 m for the female and 2175 m for the male.

<collectingCountry box="[774,895,2649,2682]" name="Ethiopia" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Ethiopia</collectingCountry>
, a female had a home range of 1-7 km?, with a core area of 0-2 km* (centered on Hagenia and Juniperus woodlands). In southwestern 
<collectingCountry box="[390,469,2727,2760]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, a young female had a home range of 1-4 km? she used 0-2 km?® in the first month, 0-7 km? the second, and 1-2 km®in the third, suggesting that she was increasing her home range as she got older. The radio-collared male in this study appeared to be a dispersing individual as he covered an area of 50 km? The mean daily distance travelled in 24 hours was 2978 m for the female and 8050 m for the male. Two types of movement were detected: a zig-zag run (associated with searching for food and hunting) and a more or less straight-line run (travelling). Further studies in southwestern 
<collectingCountry box="[389,468,3006,3035]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, revealed a mean home range size of 7-8 km? for eight individuals (range 0-73-14-71 km?); there was a large inter-sexual and a low intra-sexual overlap of ranges. The mean distance travelled was 2:78 km/day; the mean distance between consecutive resting sites was 0-73 km. The density of adults was estimated to be 0-33 individuals/km?®. In northern 
<collectingCountry box="[617,696,3168,3193]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>

<collectingCountry box="[557,636,3198,3231]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, the mean annual home range size was 1-13 km” in males and 0-72 km? in females; resting home range sizes were nine times lower than overall home range sizes. Home range sizes changed with the seasons and were smallestin the summer (0-41 km? in males and 0-29 km? in females) and largest in the spring (0-79 km? in males and 0-56 km?” in females). Core areas represented 27% ofthe total home range in males and 19% in females. Intra-sexual home range overlap was lower than inter-sexual overlap; there was no overlap of core areas. The minimum density was 0-98 individuals/km*. Common Genets deposit their feces in latrines, which are either elevated (on rocks and in trees) or on the ground. More than one individual may use the same latrine and a large number of feces can be found in them. They are more frequently located on the edges of home ranges. In 
<collectingCountry box="[2356,2436,486,519]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, the number of feces in 27 latrines ranged from one to 27, with seven containing only one scat. More than one individual appeared to use these latrines. Feces were found in trees (44% on main trunks, 22% on secondary trunks, 15% on raptor nests, and 7% on branches), on thickets or hedges (7%), and on the ground (4%). Feces on trees were situated on average 4-2 m high. Each genet tended to deposit feces all over the surface of the latrine (never over fresh feces, but over old ones). Scattered feces were also found on the ground. Within the study area, Common Genets inhabited mesic scrubland patches and preferentially deposited their feces on the edges of these patches. The number of feces in latrines was highest in February-March and November-December, and lowest in April-August. Among 15 latrines, only five were continuously used for at least four months and only one was always used. All were close to resting sites and when these were deserted the latrines were no longer used. In central 
<collectingCountry box="[2362,2442,958,991]" name="Spain" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Spain</collectingCountry>
, fecalsites were in areas with high rock and shrub cover, habitats that provided good feeding places and refuges. In south-west 
<collectingCountry box="[1851,1971,1040,1069]" name="Portugal" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Portugal</collectingCountry>
, the selection of latrine and scent marking sites was driven by the availability of shelter and food: latrines were more often in habitat with high understory cover. Latrines were usually located on conspicuous structures: old-growth trees were the dominant latrine sites. In south-west 
<collectingCountry box="[2368,2465,1154,1187]" name="France" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">France</collectingCountry>
, latrines were often located on rocks and were found to contain ten to 65 feces, but those with higher numbers were rare and isolated feces were also found. Common Genets also use the secretion from their perineal gland and urine as a means of communication. While scent marking, they adopt a handstand posture or a flexion of the hindlegs. In captivity, scent marking behavior increased in the male and decreased in the female during the breeding season; it increased again in the female after mating, but decreased again before parturition. Captive males and females sniffed the scent marks of unknown genets more than those of known genets (of the opposite sex). They also spent more time sniffing marks of other genets than their own marks. The Common Genet also scent-marks by flank rubbing, which consists of rubbing the cheek, neck and dorsal parts of the flank against unscented vertical surfaces; these body regions have a higher density of sebaceous glands. Males are able to recognize the physiological state offemales from sniffing scent marks left by flank rubbing. Flank rubbing increases during agonistic encounters and is generally associated with visual threat signals, such as piloerection of the dorsal crest and the tail. Intimidating behavior in Common Genets is very cat-like, with an arched-back stance, erection of the dorsal crest and tail hairs, hissing, and an open mouth showing the teeth.

There may be two breeding seasons in 
<collectingCountry box="[2159,2245,1862,1895]" name="Kenya" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Kenya</collectingCountry>
, from March to May and September to December, which correspond to the wet seasons. One adult female was found lactating in southwestern

<collectingCountry box="[1465,1596,2019,2052]" name="Botswana" pageId="11" pageNumber="218">Botswana</collectingCountry>
from October to February. Elsewhere in southern Africa, pregnant females have been taken in September, October, and January. In Europe and North Africa, mating mainly occurs in the spring and autumn; birth peaks are in April to June and September to November. Breeding behavior has been mainly observed in captivity. Several days before mating, the male and female increase their uro-genital marking activity; the male emits contact calls, and sniffs the ano-genital region and flanks of the female. Copulations occur at night, last two or three minutes, and are repeated up to five times. Gestation is 70 to 77 days. Natal den sites are in hollow trees, burrows, and rocky crevices. Litter size is one to four; the most common number is two. Newborns are covered with hair and have closed ears and eyes. Weight at birth is 60 to 85 g; the young are 300 g at one month, 450 g at two months, 900 g at four months, and 1500 g at eight months. They nurse during the first four months and start eating solid food when they are about 45 days old. They start to pursue prey at twelve weeks and have acquired their predator skills by the 18&quot; week. They are sexually mature at around 19-24 months.
