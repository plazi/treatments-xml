The saddle is vermiculated or marbled black, with ocherous buff or gray tones. The rump and thighs are reddish orange. Innersides of forearms are black, variably mixed with orange or reddish. Inner sides of upper arms are black to dominantly reddish. The belly is reddish orange. The tail is black, except for a short rufous basal part. External genitalia are mostly or entirely pigmented. The “White-mantled Saddleback Tamarin” (S. w. melanoleucus) is almost entirely creamy white (often washed or streaked with yellowish buffy hairs), contrasting the black of the ears, facial skin, and external genitalia. Underparts and inner surface of limbs are whitish or yellowish to ocherous. The forehead has a poorly defined white band, and hairs surrounding the mouth and nostrils are grayish. In the “Crandall’s Saddle-back Tamarin” (S. w. crandally), the crown, mantle, and arms are yellowish drab. The rump, legs and thighs are orange, and the tail is brown with orange underneath on the proximal one-fifth. There is a broad, well-defined, white, transverse band across the forehead (chevron). The throat, neck, and chest are buffy to nearly white. Facial skin is pigmented. There are short gray hairs around the mouth and sides of the nostrils. The saddle is vermiculated buffy and black. Upper surfaces of hands are drab, and those of the feet are mixed buffy and orange, with dark bases of the hairs showing through. External genitalia are pigmented black.

, home ranges always contain a mosaic of forest types and always with successional forest patches from windfalls or new growth from changes in river courses. They do not occur in large tracts of mature forest with sparse understories. A comparative study of habitat use by Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarin showed that they tended to use small (less than 5 cm in diameter), medium, and large branches (more than 10 cm in diameter) in roughly equal proportions, whereas “mustached tamarins” (Red-bellied Tamarin, S.

) used small supports more and larger supports less. Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins used horizontal supports much less and vertical supports much more, and spent much more time on tree trunks and less time on branches than Red-bellied and the Emperor tamarins. When jumping, they went from branch to branch much less and from a branch to a trunk, or between trunks, more than the two species of mustached tamarins, which mostly jumped from branch to branch. Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins foraged for animal prey at an average height above the ground of 6-1 m and forfruits at 11-2 m. In contrast, the two species of mustached tamarins foraged for insects at an average of 9-4 m above the ground and for fruits at 16-7 m. These measurements clearly define structural and vertical differences in forest habitats occupied by these species and differences in foraging techniques and sites, resulting in clear differences in their animal prey. Demographic and ecological studies of Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarin living in mixed groups with the Emperor Tamarin were carried out by J. Terborgh and A. Goldizen for more than 13 years at Cocha Cashu in Manu National Park and Biosphere Reserve,

, systematic visitation to their inflorescences implies that tamarins are important pollinators. The main difference in the diets of Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins and Emperor Tamarins is in their methods and localities for searching for animal prey. Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins dedicated 62% of their foraging time to investigating knotholes and crevicesin trees, vines, and palms for hidden prey, 22% looking along branches, and 8% looking among leaves. In contrast, Emperor Tamarins were scanning foliage-gleaners (86% of their foraging time) and used a stealth-and-pounce capture method for exposed but often cryptic prey; less than 1% of their foraging was spent investigating crevices. Emperor Tamarins spent more than 50% of their time foraging among vines, whereas Weddell’s Saddleback Tamarins searched mostly lower down on tree trunks (68%). The two species exploited different animal prey. The nominate form of Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarin caught more large insects (e.g. grasshoppers,

. When traveling, Redbellied Tamarins tended to lead and were followed by the saddle-backs and then the Goeldi’s Monkeys. Red-bellied Tamarins moved higher up in the forest (77% of their traveling and foraging above 10 m from the ground) and traveled more quickly, using mainly quadrupedal running and jumping. Goeldi’s Monkeys often lagged behind by as much as ten minutes, using their predominantly vertical-clinging and leaping locomotion in the lowest part of the understory below 5 m above the ground. Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins moved and foraged above them, usually below 10 m above the ground, using a mix of vertical-clinging and leaping and quadrupedal running and jumping. The mustached tamarins also tended to be the first to begin activity after a resting period. As was found in Manu, the larger mustached tamarins were dominant to the smaller saddle-backs when the two interacted socially or had a dispute (rarely) over a food item.

<emphasis box="[1346,1480,2884,2917]" pageId="24" pageNumber="329">Breeding.</emphasis>
At Manu, 22 births of Weddell’s Saddle-back Tamarins in eleven groups occurred in the late dry season and rainy season from late August to March. Their breeding strategy was either monogamous (just one breeding pair) or polyandrous (more than one male mates with the breeding female and cares for the young). Usually, as is typical of callitrichids, there is only one breeding female in a group, but breeding by secondary females does occur. When this happens, secondary females give birth at least three months before or three months after the primary breeding female (always the older of the two), avoiding competition for infant carriers. There is evidently some competition between adult females for breeding positions. In eight of ten years of data from Manu, the number of mature females that did not breed exceeded the number of breeding females. There are some interesting differences between the sexes in terms of their reproductive strategies. Females that manage to obtain breeding positions usually do so when they are 2-5 years old, typically either in their natal group (taking over from their mother) or in a neighboring group. Territorial encounters between groups enable adult females to assess their chances of establishing themselves in neighboring groups. In some cases, however, females left their group and established a new one with emigrating males. Many females disappear when they are 2-5-4-5 years old because they leave the group to look for breeding positions and many die as a result. Joining neighboring groups is the main dispersal strategy of the females. From observations of groups in eleven territories during 13 years of study, only two females entered groups that were not their neighbors, and only one female entered a group that was not a former member of any of the groups that were studied. Average tenure of the breeding female in a group was 3-3-5 years. Groups contained more than one adult male far more often than two adult females. Copulations were recorded in seven groups, and in six of them, two males mated with the same female (i.e. polyandrous). The polyandrous males were sometimes related to each other, sometimes not. The high frequency of polyandry indicated that males may be more successful than females in leaving their groups to search for breeding opportunities. While only one female immigrated into the study population over the 13-year study, at least nine males did so. The need for help in the care of infants seems to favor this polyandrous system. Offspring of the breeding pair help in carrying their younger brothers and sisters, and when there are no older offspring in the group to provide this help, both males and females benefit from the aid of a second male. Another sex difference noted was in terms of secondary emigration. No females transferred from one group to another more than once, but males did, although infrequently (only four known cases during the 13-year study). This may be due to males forming polyandrous groups when there are no offspring to help with infant rearing, but when the group grows and the surplus male’s help is no longer beneficial, the dominant male may expell the other male. In each case when a male transferred groups for a second time,it had belonged to a one female—two male group that had bred successfully, and the male subsequently moved into another smaller group.

More timeis spent resting and less time traveling when the dominant female is pregnant or when young infants were being carried by the group members. At the beginning of the day, they tend to feed on ripe fruits first and then switch to animal prey. Resting sessions occur throughout the day but are predominant at 11:00-13:00 h. They feed again at a fruiting tree in the late afternoon before retiring to their sleeping tree, normally at 16:00-17:00 h.
