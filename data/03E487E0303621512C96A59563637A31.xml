): Within the testis all stages of spermiogenesis are present. Spermatids of the same developmental stage are arranged in cysts. Early spermatids are characterized by a large, mainly spherical nucleus that is surrounded by a manchette of microtubules. The acrosomal complex, which is composed of a small, cylindrical AV and the AF, is formed at the anterior pole of the nucleus (
