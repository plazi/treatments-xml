At both, burrow entrances were open as were main tunnels, but laterals leading to cells were soil filled. Small concentric tumuli were also evident at Guandacol and at Pampa Vieja in 1991 but not in 1993, perhaps because there were fewer active nests. I suspected in 1991 that nests seemed to contain single females, as had already been reported by

Main tunnels tended to descend vertically but then turned and meandered at the cell level, where many branched and perhaps anastomozed. Burrow walls were unlined and obviously (though not tested) water absorbent. Many cells were arranged singly but some were in linear series of 2. All were horizontal or tilted as much as 30°; diameter of entrance was 1.5 mm (

In lateral outline, cell shape was an elongate oval, somewhat more elongate than the one diagrammed by Neff (1986: figs. 2, 3), and cell closures were deeply concave spirals of about 3 coils to the radius, deeper than depicted by Neff (ibid.). Cell walls appeared unlined (unlike those of any other exomalopsine taxon described in this paper), as was also reported by Neff. They were tested with a water droplet, which was absorbed immediately.

Intermediate-stage larvae have dorsal paired tubercles on most body segments, but these tubercles all but disappear later. Older larvae were encountered encircling the provisions so that the provisions no longer touched any part of the cell wall. These larvae had positioned themselves approximately in the equatorial plane of the cell (i.e., at right angle to the cell’s long axis) so that they touched the cell wall with most of their dorsal surface while they circled the provisions. At this stage a larva starts defecating while still feeding, excreting greenish-brown elongate fecal pellets. Because the larva crawls (presumably with remnants of its dorsal tubercles) in the equatorial plane of the cell, almost all of the feces are applied as a broad band circling the cell wall. This band when complete forms a dark grayish-green belt up to
