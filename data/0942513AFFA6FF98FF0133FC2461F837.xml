medullary tissues are less extensive than those reported for neognaths, which may be explained by many factors. First, there

a wide range of MB morphologies in extant taxa (20), varying with both reproductive phase and the position of the egg within the reproductive tract (6). Medullary tissues become thinner as shelling progresses and disappear completely with deposition of the last egg. If the same was true of dinosaurs,

most extensive in smaller taxa with high reproductive rates, because of the demand for rapid mobilization of skeletal calcium for shelling. Extinct theropods produced hardshelled eggs, as did other dinosaurs and all extant birds (29, 30). Although egg size is not known, eggs were most likely smaller relative to overall body size than in extant birds, resulting in less demand for bone calcium reserves and reducing the need to offset resorption. These factors may also contribute to the smaller ratio of medullary to cortical thickness in theropods than in extant birds. Finally, T.
