), the tegmen is better preserved. In the fully developed, and also in the underdeveloped or aborted ovules/seeds the exotegmen consists of narrow, thick-walled cells. Meso- and endotegmen are only well preserved in the aborted or undeveloped ovules/seeds, where they consist of several layers of larger, thin-walled cells. The tegmen probably served as a nutritive tissue for the developing embryo and was consumed in the two fully mature seeds
