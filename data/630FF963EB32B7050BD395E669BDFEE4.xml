Shortly thereafter, tectonic movements began to subdivide this structure in various complex ways. Biogeographically, the single most important implication of the GAARlandia hypothesis is that certain South American mammals, and possibly other terrestrial animals, may have been able to disperse up the landspan into the future Greater Antilles before subsidence and tectonic dismemberment occurred. The central importance of the idea of GAARlandia is that it provides a common­cause explanation for many aspects of faunal formation in the Greater Antilles. Naturally, the explanatory power of this hypothesis is dependent on whether these events have been correctly chronicled, and it is therefore important to test it against the results of other investigations, whether biological or geological, whenever opportunity offers.</paragraph>

) inferred that the Mona Passage first appeared as a marine basin in the Middle Miocene (~11–16 Ma). Our grounds for this inference were that (1) on both the Hispani­ olan and Puerto Rican sides of the Mona Passage, deformed Cretaceous/Paleogene arc sections outcrop below Quaternary limestones, suggesting that there had been a barrier to marine deposition (i.e., a land connection) until late in the Cenozoic; and (2) regional tectonic reconstructions implied that the Passage was of late or neotectonic origin (more specifically, that the Passage was formed as a consequence of Miocene–Pliocene extensional stress due to rotation of

Although this is an interesting possibility, some cautionary notes have to be sounded. The absence of well corings or accessible outcrops and the lack of uniform thickness in the lower part of the seismostratigraphic section mean, in effect, that there is no direct evidence of the section’s actual age, nor any way currently to verify the proposed age for the sedimentary section filling the Passage.

Notwithstanding the need for additional evidence, if indeed the Mona Passage opened in the Oligocene, we propose the earliest empirically defensible date should be approximately 30 Ma or slightly earlier (i.e., in the medial rather than the Early Oligocene), coincident with extensive development of marine rocks in the northern and southern late Tertiary basins of

An earlier opening of the Mona Passage (by 10 Ma or more compared to our original estimate) has some interesting implications. With regard to Antillean paleogeography, redating the opening strongly reinforces our suspicion that the period of maximum continuity and emergence of GAARlandia (see above) had to have been extremely short (

). In particular, van Gestel et al. (1999) do not accept that portions of this block have been continuously emergent since the latest Eocene, preferring instead a three­phase tectonic evolution that allows for considerable periods of nonemergence. The three phases, largely based on their interpretations of offshore seismic reflection data from the North Coast Basin, are as follows: phase 1, Cretaceous to Middle Eocene, active vulcanism, uplift, emergent land along axis of island arc; phase 2, medial Oligocene to Early Pliocene, ‘‘period of tectonic quiescence’’, complete subsidence of the PRVIB, carbonates deposited across latter’s entire width; and phase 3, Early Pliocene to Holocene, uplift, re­emergence, and acquisition of present coastlines. Importantly, the very short interval stipulated for Neogene emergence (Pliocene and later) is plainly inconsistent with a lengthy history of vertebrate colonization of the PRVIB, whether this was accomplished by overwater or landspan dispersal.

Separate recognition of the Late Eocene/Early Oligocene phase of uplift is critical, because it covers the ‘‘post arc’’ orogenic deformation which had wide effects along the whole Greater Antilles/ Aves Rise (and, not incidentally, led to the formation of GAARlandia). Supporting evidence for this uplift event as it affected the PRVIB is diverse (Monroe, 1980; MacPhee and Iturralde­Vinent, 1995b; Larue et al., 1998;

Equally problematic is the characterization of phase 2 by van Gestel et al. (1999) as a ‘‘period of tectonic quiescence’’ and complete subsidence from the mid­Oligocene to Early Pliocene. Long­established facts lead to just the opposite conclusion. Although the northern and southern flanks of

The following points lend further support to this contention (see

An ‘‘emergence history’’ of part of eastern GAARlandia (eastern Hispaniola, Mona Passage, and Puerto Rico), from Late Eocene to mid­Pliocene. Diagram indicates that the eastern Hispaniola block and the Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands block were connected and subaerial during the brief GAARlandia landspan phase. Since Early Oligocene, parts of GAARlandia began to founder and subdivide, as is suggested by the presence of thin marine intercalations in the dominantly terrestrial section of San Sebastian Fm and Juana Diaz Fm (above the basal conglomerates). Mona Passage began to open as a consequence of movements along major faults and rotation of the PRVIB, but probably did not become a permanent marine barrier until 30 Ma or somewhat later. Opening was doubtless progressive, although this is not depicted here. Terrestrial environments are distinguished from shelf and marine environments by shading conventions (see key). Vertical/horizontal extent of shading indicates continuity of the environment in question over time/area. Thus, the panels representing eastern Hispaniola and Puerto Rico indicate that, while subaerial land has been continuously present since the Late Eocene, the amount has clearly varied (scale is suggestive only). In the panels, symbols for terrestrial fossils are positioned within named formations if there is paleontological evidence for the presence of land plants or animals in relevant sediments.

Monroe (1980: 57) stated that, notwithstanding the absence of clastics in Aymamon rocks, land of ‘‘very low relief that probably stood not far above sea level’’ was still present in the Middle Miocene. Perhaps most importantly, he also noted that there is no positive evidence that the interior of
