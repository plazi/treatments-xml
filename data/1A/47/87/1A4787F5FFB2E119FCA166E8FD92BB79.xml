Nutritive tissue is partly preserved in five of the specimens that were studied using SRXTM. Two of these specimens (S174820, S174821) also had a complete embryo preserved. In both cases the embryo is tiny, about 130 µm long and 130 µm broad, with two rudimentary cotyledons and an embryo to seed (E: S) ratio of about 0.02. The embryo is composed of cells that are much smaller than the surrounding nutritive tissue. Each cell contains a dense, central structure that may be the fossilized remains of a nucleus (
