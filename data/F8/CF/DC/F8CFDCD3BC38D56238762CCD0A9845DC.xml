Frontal large, narrowing anteriorly where it bifurcates around posterior portion of mesethmoid; in post orbital region, frontal bears a descending lateral wing, which joins sphenotic and prootic; in supraorbital region, frontal bears a groove for supraorbital canal (Springer, 1983); posterior end of frontal forms a large portion of roof of braincase; it joins pterosphenoid (Fig. 4) ventrally to form dorsoposterior wall of orbit; laterally, it overlaps sphenotic and partially overlaps supraoccipital posterolaterally. Sphenotic joins pterotic and supraoccipital posteriorly and prootic ventromedially; sphenotic smaller than pterotic, and articulates with anteriormost dorsal condyle of hyomandibular.

Groove in anterior surface of hyomandibular receives metapterygoid; ventral projecting surface synchondrally joins with posterior head of symplectic. Most of posterolateral surface of hyomandibular overlain by preopercle, which fits into large groove formed by wide, thin posterolateral projection of hyomandibular. At approximate centre of medial surface of hyomandibular lies large foramen, which leads to canal exiting anteroventrally on lateral surface, canal carries the hyomandibular branch of facial nerve (Birdsong, 1975; Freihofer, 1978). Metapterygoid slender and elongate, not reaching quadrate; broadly overlaps, and tightly joined to, posterolateral surface of symplectic ventrally, and anterodorsal surface of hyomandibular posteriorly.
