Gill (Fig. 5I) composed of 8 slender thread-like filaments, arranged as [(1+2) (or 2+1)+(1+2)]+2 filaments from dorsal to ventral; common basal stalk medium-long (0.74-0.92 times as long as interspiracular trunk); dorsal and middle triplets share short stalk; dorsal triplet composed of 1 individual and 2 paired filaments with short to medium-long primary stalk and short secondary stalk, and middle triplet composed of 1 individual and 2 paired filaments and bearing medium-long primary stalk and short secondary stalk; ventral paired filaments with medium-long to long stalk which is 1.02-1.36 times as long as common basal stalk and 0.89-1.04 times as long as interspiracular trunk; stalk of ventral pair 1.00-1.08 and 1.27-1.43 times as thick as primary stalks of middle and dorsal triplets, respectively, but 0.88-0.96 times as thick as common stalk of middle and dorsal triplets; primary stalk of dorsal triplet lying against stalk of lower pair at angle of 60-80 degrees when viewed laterally; 3 filaments of dorsal triplet subequal in length (about 2.0 mm long including their own stalks and common basal stalk) and thickness to one another; 3 filaments of middle triplet subequal in length (2.1-2.3 mm long including their own stalks and common basal stalk) and thickness to one another; 2 filaments of ventral pair subequal in length (2.5-2.6 mm long including their own stalk and common basal stalk) and thickness to each other, and 1.38-1.43 and 1.39-1.43 times as thick as those of middle and dorsal triplets, respectively, when compared basally. Abdomen. Dorsally, segments 6-9 each with spine-combs (though those on segment 9 somewhat smaller than those on segment 8) in transverse row and comb-like groups of minute spines on each side; segment 9 with pair of small triangular flat terminal hooks of which outer margin is 1.15 times as long as inner margin and weakly undulated (Fig. 5J). Cocoon. Wall pocket-shaped, thinly and rather roughly woven, somewhat extended ventrolaterally; anterior margin no

<paragraph id="055A9E5A3CC6DA79A84922C323BF1C1D" pageId="12" pageNumber="65">Mature larva. Body length 3.9 mm. Body creamy with color markings as follows: thoracic segment 1 encircled with ochreous broad transverse band (though disconnected ventrally), proleg grayish, thoracic segments 2 and 3 light ochreous dorsally and each with distinct ochreous wide areas ventrally, abdominal segments 1-4 each encircled with grayish broad band, abdominal segment 3 also faintly encircled with reddish-purplish band, abdominal segments 5-8 almost entirely covered by sheet of reddish-purplish pigment on dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces (though anterior portion of abdominal segment 5 narrowly unpigmented), from which colored narrow band extends to various extent either laterally or ventrolaterally or even ventrally on each of segments 5-8 (color of band on segments 5, 6 and 8 reddish-purplish and that on segment 7 grayish), and abdominal segment 7 with reddish-purplish transverse broad band ventrally. Cephalic apotome dark yellow, moderately covered with minute setae; head spots very faintly positive. Lateral surface of head capsule yellow except eye-spot region whitish, sparsely covered with minute setae; spots indistinct. Ventral surface of head capsule yellow except darkened area near posterior margin on each side of postgenal cleft, and sparsely covered with minute setae. Antenna composed of 3 segments and apical sensillum, somewhat longer than stem of labral fan; proportional lengths of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd segments 1.00:0.72:0.92. Labral fan with 30 main rays. Mandible with 3 comb-teeth decreasing in length from 1st to 3rd; mandibular serration composed of 2 teeth (1 medium-sized and 1 small); major tooth at acute angle against mandible on apical side; supernumerary serrations absent. Hypostoma (Fig. 5K) with row of 9 apical teeth; median tooth prominent, right corner tooth nearly as long as inner one of intermediate teeth and slightly longer than remaining outer and median teeth, but left corner tooth shorter than outer and median ones of intermediate teeth (this unexpected short corner tooth as well as lack of 2 lateral teeth on left side suggesting anterolateral portion of hypostoma on left side abnormally formed); lateral margin smooth; 4 or 5 hypostomal bristles per side lying slightly divergent posteriorly from lateral margin. Postgenal cleft (Fig. 5L) lanceolate, (its length ratio against postgenal bridge is not accurately attainable due to posterior part of hypostoma which is widely detached from head capsule and folded inward, making it difficult to measure length of postgenal bridge). Cervical sclerite composed of 2 yellow small pieces, not fused to occiput, widely separated medially from each other. Thoracic cuticle bare. Abdominal cuticle almost bare except few posterior segments sparsely to moderately covered with simple minute setae dorsally and dorsolaterally and last segment densely covered with colorless simple setae on each side of anal sclerite. Rectal scales absent. Rectal papilla compound (number of secondary lobules not countable because rectal papilla is withdrawn). Anal sclerite of usual X-form, with anterior arms little longer than posterior ones, broadly sclerotized at base; accessory sclerite absent. Last abdominal segment expanded ventrolaterally forming double bulges on each side, visible as large conical ventral papilla when viewed from side. Posterior circlet with 76 rows of up to 13 hooklets per row.</paragraph>
