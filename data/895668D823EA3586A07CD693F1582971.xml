Posterior ocelli absent. Eyes very small, flat, shorter than half their distance from the mandibular insertions, placed a little in front of the middle of the head. Mandibles short, rather strongly angulate at the base externally, their apical margins oblique, with 5 or 6 denticles, those at the base often indistinct. Clypeus convex and evenly rounded in the middle, its anterior border projecting, entire, strongly emarginate on the sides. Frontal groove absent. Antennae short, scapes not reaching to the middle of the head, first funicular joint much longer than broad, joints 2 to 8 much broader than long, crowded together, joints 9 to 11 forming a three-jointed club, the last joint being as long as both the others, which are subequal and somewhat broader than long. Thorax narrower than the head, constricted in the mesonotal region. Pronotum from above a little broader than long, evenly rounded and convex; mesonotum transversely subelliptical, feebly convex, surrounded by impressed sutures. Metanotum nearly as long as the mesonotum, concave, with uneven surface. Epinotum very convex and rounded, egg-shaped from above, semiglobose in profile, as high as the pronotum or slightly higher, with the slit-shaped epinotal glands shining through the integument and conspicuously enlarged. Petiole short, scarcely longer than broad, broader behind than in front, convex and rounded above. In profile, its ventral surface is also convex and protuberant, with a small, compressed, blunt, translucent tooth anteriorly. Postpetiole a little broader than the petiole, scarcely broader than long and scarcely broader behind than in front, convex and rounded above and below. Legs and gaster of the usual shape, the latter with well-developed sting.</paragraph>

These regions also have more numerous short hairs or suberect pubescence. Antennae and legs with shorter, more appressed hairs. Cheeks and clypeus densely and conspicuously pubescent, the latter without a fringe of cilia-like bristles.</paragraph>

The pubescence is very conspicuous, extending back over the sides and front of the head and especially on the pleura;, epinotum, and nodes of the pedicel. As in the worker, the hairs and pubescence arc longest on the sides of the gaster.</paragraph>

The wings are represented by minute brownish or blackish tubercles, the anterior pair with vestigial tegula; at their bases. Some specimens (Fig. 23g) have the fore wings more developed as a pair of triangular pads with indistinct, contorted veins, and folded back over the anterior corners of the epinotum. The pilosity and pubescence are also intermediate between the worker and female; the color the same. Male.- Length 2.6 to 3 mm.</paragraph>

Eyes and ocelli rather large, convex. Mandibles small but with distinct, denticulate borders. Clypeus convex, its anterior border rounded and somewhat projecting. Frontal carinae very short. Antennal scapes about three times as long as broad, funicular joints all distinctly longer than broad, cylindrical, very gradually increasing in length to the tip. Thorax narrow and long, flattened above, peculiarly and deeply excavated on the ventral side behind the insertions of the fore coxae; mesosterna swollen. Epinotum resembling that of the female. Petiole and postpetiole much as in the worker, but the former subpedunculate, merging more gradually into the node, without a tooth on its ventral surface. Gaster long and slender. Fore wing with a single cubital cell.</paragraph>

Stitz described and figured only the worker of this species from specimens taken by Tessmann in Spanish Guinea. He gives the native Pangwe name as &quot;odschigeso&quot; and says that the insect stings more severely than

, which is a much larger and more powerful ant. He also describes one of the ergatoid females but seems to regard it as an unusual worker. In my material about 4 to 5 per cent of the specimens are ergatoid females, so that they must form a normal constituent of the colony. They probably function as egg-laying individuals and thus supplement the reproductive activities of the true females, which, judging from my material, are much less numerous.
