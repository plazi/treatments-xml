Males have a prominent preorbital chevron and occasionally cheek spots, but females have no or faint preorbital markings. The dark dorsal crest of males only rarely has white on it. Females may have rump spots or flank spots, but they are generally faint. Young are a uniform yellow-brown or dull reddish-brown, with faint or no white marks; however, preorbital spots may be distinct in young females. The young are red on the head, but the neck is paler.

Sitatungas as a group, except the Nkosi Island Sitatunga, are described as semi-aquatic, limiting most of their activities to swamps, bogs, and marshes associated with rivers, streams, lakes, and lowland forests of poor drainage that are scattered intermittently throughout their range. They are excellent swimmers, will avoid danger by escaping into deep water, and are capable of submerging their entire body with little more than their nostrils above the surface. In the Rushebeya-Kanyabaha wetland complex in south-western 
<collectingCountry box="[456,568,2442,2475]" name="Uganda" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Uganda</collectingCountry>
, 49% of the observations of Lake Victoria Sitatunga were made in wetland habitats, but it was clear that they made use of adjacent nonwetland areas (23% of observations were in lightly open sedge/papyrus clearings). Open grasslands and, interestingly, very marshy and boggy areas were least preferred.

Dietary assessments of all sitatunga species are difficult to make from direct feeding observations, which underrepresent forage obtained in forested areas that are used primarily at night and those obtained while they are concealed in swampy areas. Lake Victoria Sitatungas often feed immersed up to their backs in water and will stand on their hindlegs to reach preferred forage. In the Ituri Rainforest, 
<collectingCountry name="Democratic Republic of the Congo" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">DR Congo</collectingCountry>
, isotopic analyses of plants and teeth of the Lake Victoria Sitatunga suggest a diet of plants primarily occurring in forest gaps and clearings. About 82% of feeding observations of Lake Victoria Sitatungas in the Kipsain-Saiwa Swamp in western 
<collectingCountry box="[1205,1290,2878,2907]" name="Kenya" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Kenya</collectingCountry>
found them eating only four plant species: Typha domingensis (37%), Hydrocotyle ranunculoides (20%), Pycreus lanceus (14%) and Oenanthe palustris (11%). In the Rushebeya-Kanyabaha wetland complex in south-western 
<collectingCountry box="[761,872,2996,3025]" name="Uganda" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Uganda</collectingCountry>
, 40 plant species were eaten by Lake Victoria Sitatunga, and 60% of their diet was made up of leaves, mostly from sedges (14%, Cyperus latifolius and 10%, C. papyrus), grasses (5%, Digitaria scalarum), vines (7%, Rubus pinnatus), and various herbaceousspecies, including cultivated sweet potato (7%, Ipomoea batatas). Depredation of the sweet potato plants, particularly when they were young and tender, by the Lake Victoria Sitatunga was significant enough in fields adjacent to the wetland complex they used that farmers changed to planting of unpalatable crops such as sugarcane and pumpkins. Other crops that Lake Victoria Sitatungas damaged included Irish potato, maize, and cabbage. Distance from the wetland complex to cultivated fields played a role in levels of depredation; 90% ofall observations of Lake Victoria Sitatungas were within 100 m of the wetland’s edge. New growth of plants after fires is attractive to Lake Victoria Sitatunga.

In most locations, breeding behavior and births take place throughout the year. Breeding behavior of captive sitatungas in the Audubon Zoo, New Orleans, 
<collectingCountry box="[2488,2552,478,507]" name="United States of America" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">USA</collectingCountry>
, presumed to be Lake Victoria Sitatungas, follows a pattern typical of the tragelaphine group. Males frequently horn the ground and vegetation and spar with other males with locked horns while pushing and twisting; this behavior did not seem to be serious fighting but rather “play-fighting,” perhaps to establish dominance. Males investigated the anogenital region of females daily, typically approaching in a low-stretch posture with neck extended and then sniffing and licking the females. If the female urinated, the male displayed the lip-curl response. Estrus lasted three days, during which a male was in constant contact with the female. Anogential investigations by the male became very vigorous, to the point oflifting her hindquarters off the ground. The male rested his chin on the female’s hindquarters, and if she did not move away, he mounted. Copulation was brief but sometimes took several attempts to be successful. In the wild, the courtship ritual has not been observed very often but appears to be comparable to captive observations. In the Kipsain-Saiwa Swamp in western 
<collectingCountry box="[2218,2305,989,1018]" name="Kenya" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Kenya</collectingCountry>
, one male repeatedly approached a female’s hindquarters with his head lowered and held forward, his horns lying along his back. He smelled her genital region and rubbed the side of his head against her flank. After 20 minutes of repeated approaches, the female let the male mount. Sometimes, as a courting male slowly and deliberately approaches a female, instead of slowly walking away, she will bound off erratically, stand still for a minute, and then dash off again. The male just continues his slow, deliberate following of such a female. Gestation is 7-5-8 months in captivity, with a birth interval of 11-6 months, indicating that captive females typically conceive about four months after giving birth. In captivity, twinning is very rare, only 0-18% of births. Females give birth on dry reed platforms that they create by trampling the vegetation, and they keep their neonates well concealed until the young can move through the dense swamp vegetation. Females groom their offspring often, and the pair remain very close to each other for several months; young may remain with their mothers even after the next offspring is born.

<collectingCountry box="[2259,2371,1889,1922]" name="Rwanda" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Rwanda</collectingCountry>
; investigators concluded there were 9000 individuals in 600 km?, or a density of 15 ind/km?®. In Saiwa Swamp National Park in western 
<collectingCountry box="[1829,1916,1968,2001]" name="Kenya" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Kenya</collectingCountry>
, densities were about 55 ind/km* in the early 1970s. As a group, sitatunga are not very gregarious, and adults tend to occur alone except during breeding. Group sizes in 
<collectingCountry box="[1893,1978,2046,2079]" name="Kenya" pageId="34" pageNumber="605">Kenya</collectingCountry>
were 45-9% single individual, 34-8% two individuals, 10-6% three individuals, 5% four individuals, and 1-7-0-3% five to nine individuals. The population structure there, based on 648 observations, was dominated by females: 50-5% adult females, 15-3% immature females, 13-1% adult males, 17-9% immature males, and only 3-2% young-of-the-year (but they were likely underrepresented because of difficulties observing them). When disturbed, male Lake Victoria Sitatungas often bark to each other, mostly at night; femalesare typically quiet but will emit low-pitched squeaks to each other while feeding. The Lake Victoria Sitatunga can live up to 20 years in captivity, and perhaps only about twelve years in the wild.

As many as 170,000 sitatungas may occur discontinuously throughout the group’s range in Africa, with about 40% living in protected areas. That number, however,is considered an overestimate, and local populations are threatened by loss of habitat, altered hydrology oftheir critical wetland habitats,livestock grazing and likely associated disease transmission, uncontrolled burning of swampland, and overharvest for subsistence and the bushmeat trade.
