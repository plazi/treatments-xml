, Africa. The Forest Buffalo is considered by some to be the ancestral form of the African buffaloes. The synonymy of the Forest Buffalo is complex, depending on whether the West African populations, which are somewhat larger in size with slightly greater horn span on average, are recognized as a distinct subspecies. There are slight average differences between West and Central African populations of Forest Buffaloes, and there are intermediate populations between this species and the Lake

Head—-body 180-220 cm,tail 70 cm, shoulder height 100-130 cm; weight 2656-320 kg. The Forest Buffalo is distinctly smaller than the other three African buffalo species, and although still cattle-like, it appears much less massive than the

Buffalo. It is generally pale reddish-brown, with dark markings on the limbs and shoulders, but some individuals are entirely black. The horns of the Forest Buffalo are shorter than the other species and do not curve much laterally; they mainly curve upward, forming a crescent. Their length is greater than the total span, a discrepancy that is greater in Central than in West African populations. Horn span is 34-1-65-5 cm and 34-5-72 cm, and horn length along the curve is 41-69 cm and 35-635 cm in Central and West African specimens, respectively. The bases of horns do not form a convex boss, as on the other savanna buffalo species. The skull is less massive than in the other species, but still short, broad, and convex in profile. The greatest length of the skull is 39-4-46-8 cm and 41-1-49-2 cm and the mastoid breadth is 13-7-25-7 cm and 19-9-27-6 cm in Central and West African specimens, respectively. The ears very large and prominent, with heavy fringes on the lateral (= inferior) edges; the long thick hair begins well into the inner surface of the pinnae. Two streaks of long white to pale yellow hair cross the ears and extend off the bottom edge. The mouth is wide, and the nose is moist and bare. The tail is tufted. No scent glands have been described in the Forest Buffalo. Dental formulais10/3,C0/1,P 3/3, M 3/3 (x2) = 32.

Forest Buffaloes prefer open, grassy areas and watercourses in the rainforest belt of Central and Western Africa. They can be found in forest-savannas in drier areas in their range as well as areas of near-continuous primary and secondary forest. In south-western 
<collectingCountry box="[500,596,1003,1028]" name="Gabon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Gabon</collectingCountry>

<collectingCountry name="Central African Republic" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Central African Republic</collectingCountry>

Little specific information on the diet of Forest Buffaloes is available, but given their occupation of the rainforests, their diets likely are composed of fewer grasses than other African buffaloes occupying more open and drier savannas. In Campo-Ma’an National Park, southern 
<collectingCountry box="[806,957,1388,1421]" name="Cameroon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Cameroon</collectingCountry>

There is no specific information available for this species. Presumably similar to other African buffalo species, but without pronounced seasonality in breeding and birthing periods. Maximum longevity in the wild may be 18-20 years, perhaps less. Forest Buffaloes have lived more than 28 years in captivity.

Forest Buffaloes follow the same general activity patterns of other ruminants, with feeding periods followed by resting/ruminating periods throughout the day and night. Forest Buffaloes in Lopé National Park, 
<collectingCountry box="[1046,1141,1821,1854]" name="Gabon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Gabon</collectingCountry>
, spent about 30% of the day feeding, mostly in the morning in savanna habitat, and more than 38% of the day resting/ruminating, often in the afternoon in marshes. Activity patterns did not differ annually or seasonally at Lopé, but individual buffaloes varied somewhat in the time they devoted to feeding and resting. In Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, 
<collectingCountry name="Central African Republic" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Central African Republic</collectingCountry>
, groups of Forest Buffaloes tended to move rotationally from one forest clearing to another; clearings were favored as resting places during the day, but forests were preferred for resting during the night.

<emphasis box="[1471,2162,288,321]" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Movements, Home range and Social organization.</emphasis>
Numbers of Forest Buffaloes are difficult to estimate because oftheir often localized distribution and the forest cover they typically occupy. Density estimates range from 0-1-0-3 ind/km? in near-continuous forests to 6-4 ind/km? in secondary forests with open canopies and greater understory development. In a coastal shrub area in Réserve de Faune du Petit Loango, 
<collectingCountry box="[2569,2665,454,479]" name="Gabon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Gabon</collectingCountry>
, density was 1-75 ind/km?, but it was only 0-01-0-4 ind/ km? in Campo-Ma’an National Park, southern 
<collectingCountry box="[1689,1837,524,557]" name="Cameroon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Cameroon</collectingCountry>
(highest along logging roads and their associated habitat). Forest Buffaloes do not have to move extensively in search of water and ephemeral food resources, as do many Cape Buffalo populations; therefore, movement patterns and home ranges are much smaller. Forest Buffaloes in Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, 
<collectingCountry box="[1472,1826,681,714]" name="Central African Republic" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Central African Republic</collectingCountry>
, moved greater distances from forest to clearings in the dry season than the rainy season. While moving, individuals at Dzanga-Ndokistayed closer together than they did while foraging, and the amount of time spent foraging by each individual increased with increasing group size. Home range sizes of adult females in Lopé National Park, 
<collectingCountry box="[1774,1869,842,871]" name="Gabon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Gabon</collectingCountry>
, were 2-3-7-64 km?, and there waslittle overlap among them. Individual home ranges were stable over two years of study and were dominated by savanna habitat despite there being a greater proportion offorests in the landscape. Habitat use varied seasonally; marsh habitat was preferred over forest in September—February and forests were preferred in March—-August. Generally, the buffaloes rested/ruminated in forests, fed in savannas, and rested and wallowed in marshes. In the Lopé study area of 72 km?®, about 340 buffaloes lived in 18 relatively stable groups with a mean size of twelve individuals (range of means 3-24, maximum size observed 46). Groups occupying a traditional home range have been thought to be stable, but one of nine radio-collared females in Lopé switched groups. This suggests some fluidity in group membership, but not as much as for Cape Buffalo groups. In coastal 
<collectingCountry box="[2569,2664,1235,1264]" name="Gabon" pageId="17" pageNumber="588">Gabon</collectingCountry>
, mean group size was smaller at 5-1 buffaloes.

Recent oil exploration near the Gabonese town of Gamba has resulted in unsustainable illegal harvest of forest wildlife. During a one-year survey in the late 1990s, 54 Forest Buffaloes were tallied in Gamba’s market, representing an estimated removal of 22-7 kg/km?/year from the Gamba Protected Areas Complex, the fourth highest among 30 wildlife species noted in the market. In the late 1990s, the IUCN/SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the total number of Forest Buffaloes at 60,000, with 75% of them occurring in and around protected areas in
